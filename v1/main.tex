\chapter{Numerical Approximation of Conservation Laws}
\label{ch:nummethods}

Laws of conservation form a foundation of physics. Their complex matematical from, however, makes them challanging ti treat numerically. Thus, approximations are required. In this chapter we briefly outline high-order, state-of-the-art numerical methods for the solution of conservation laws. Owing to their key importance in physics, the amount of literature concerning the topic is extensive. Thus, we shall limit our discussion to what is relevant to this thesis, whilst keep the discussion brief. \gray{A particular focus will be set on general-relativistic hydrodynamics} \\

This chapter is organized as following. \gray{In section ... ... ... }

\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:theory:conserv_laws:theorback}

In this section we outline the mathematical theory of conservation laws, and then, techniques of how they can be implemented numerically. Of particular importance, stand topics of weak and entropic solution for conservation laws, their existance and uniqueness. With respect to the numerical applications, we discuss the consistency, stability and convergence, as well as Lax-Richtmeyer theorem. We conclude with a brief overview of the case of non-linear equations. The brief discusstion that we provide here is based on the fundamental works by \cite{LeVeque:1992} and \cite{Tadmor1998}. We refer to them for more in-depth discussion. 

\subsection{Conservation Laws}

If we consider a basic form of conservation laws, 

%% eq 2.1 and 2.2 in the SOURCE 
\begin{align} 
\partial_t\boldsymbol{u} + \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{u}) = 0, \hspace{10mm} &(t,x)\in \text{I\!R}_{+}\times\text{I\!R}^d , \\
\boldsymbol{u}(0, x) = \boldsymbol{u}(x), \hspace{18mm} &x\in \text{ I\!R},
\label{eq:theory:conservlaws}
\end{align}

where $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the vector of $m$ unknowns, $\boldsymbol{f}=(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{f}^1,...,\boldsymbol{f}^m})$ is a $d$-dimensional flux and $\boldsymbol{u_0}\in\big[L^{\infty}(\text{I\!R}^d)\big]^m$ is the initial data. \\

It can be shown that the solution of the system \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} can exhibit discontinuities (shocks) even if the initial data is smooth. Thus, a common approach is to view such a system on the notion of distributions. \\

A solution that satisfies an equation \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} in a prescribed sense, for which, however, not all the derivatives exists, is called \textit{weak solution}. It can be shown, however, that even a simple case of a scalar conservation law may have multiple weak solutions. To select a "physically preferred" solution a concept of an "entropy function" $\eta$ is introduced. This is a special (convex) function that allows to symmetrizes the spatial Jacobian, $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{u}}f^i$. Together with the entropy flux, $\psi$, derived from compatibility relation, the $\eta\psi$ constitute and \textit{entropy pair}. Then, a weak solution for which the entropy pair exists and admits

\begin{equation}
\partial_t\eta(\boldsymbol{u}) + \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\psi}(\boldsymbol{u})\leq 0,
\label{eq:theory:nummeth:entropic}
\end{equation}

is the \textit{entropic solution}. The criterion can de understood, as requiring that the process, that led to the formation of a shock is irreversible \cite{LeVeque:1992}. In a scalar case $m=1$, the existence and uniqueness was shown possible for broad range of conditions \cite{Kruzkov:1970}. The extension to the  measure-valued solutions was stated by \cite{DiPerna:1985} and to the conservation laws on manifolds \cite{Benartzi:2007}. \\

In case of a system of conservation laws, however, the existence of an entropy flux $\psi$ is not guaranteed and the uniqueness and stability of entropic solution has not been proven. 
Thus, while in one dimension and with a particular equation of state such properties can be found \textit{e.g.,} \cite{Chen:2009}, for a general equations the existence and uniqueness of the Reimann problem is not assured \cite{Curtis:1972}.

Another examples, of where the weak solution existence was found are the relativistic case \cite{Glimm:1965} with however ultrarelativistic equation of state only \cite{Smoller:1993} and strictly hyperbolic systems with a smooth enough initial conditions \cite{Lax:1957}.

For a recent review on the topic, see \textit{e.g.,} \cite{Chen:2006}. \\

\subsection{Consistency, Stability and Convergence}

For the discussion of a numerical treatment of conservation laws, several key concepts ought be to be introduced. For simplicity, we limit ourselves to the $m=1$, one-dimensional case, where $\boldsymbol{u}$ of equation \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} are scalar functions $u$. Let us further simplify notations, by viewing the solution to the 1D version of equation \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} as a a function of time only $u(t)$, a bounded "curve" in infinite dimension vector space. Then, the \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} can be viewed as an infinite system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), written symbolically as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\text{d}u(t)}{\text{d}t} = \mathcal{L}[u(t)], \hspace{10mm} u(0) = u_0,
\label{eq:theory:conservlawsode}
\end{equation}

where we associate the operator $\mathcal{L}(\cdot)$ with the $-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{f}(\cdot)$. 
Importantly, the solution to \ref{eq:theory:conservlawsode} is not necessarily smooth in time and thus ought to be considered in terms of distributions. We however, assume for the purpose of this discussion that the $u(t)$ is a smooth function. In addition, by saying $u(0) = u_0$ we have broken a certain mathematical rigor. This is acceptable for our task, however, for more details we refer to the \cite{Kruzkov:1970}. 

Now we discuss the numerical approximation to \ref{eq:theory:conservlawsode}. This begins with introducing a discretization parameter $\Delta$ into the equation \ref{eq:theory:conservlawsode} such that $u^{\Delta}\approxeq u $, $L^{\Delta}\approxeq \mathcal{L}$ and $u^{\Delta}(0) \approx u_0$. In the latter, there is an additional error associated projection operator, but it is usually negligible in comparison with the one associated with discretization. One of these errors is the \textit{truncation error}, $r^{\Delta}$, which is due to approximating $\mathcal{L}[u(t)]$ with $L^{\Delta}[u(t)]$, where $u(t)$ is the exact solution to \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws}. A scheme is called \textit{consistent} if truncation error converges to zero as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ in some (problem- and method dependent) norm for all possible initial data $u_0$. A scheme is said to be of order $r$ if $|| r^{\Delta}(t) || = \mathcal{O}(\Delta^r)$. A scheme is said to be \textit{stable} if this norm is limited $|||L^{\Delta}||| \leq C$, where $C\geq 0$ is a constant independent of $\upsilon$. And a scheme is said to be \textit{convergent} if a limit of $||u^{\Delta}(t)-u(t)|| = 0$ when $\Delta\rightarrow 0$. Lax-Richtmeyer equivalence for a linear equations state that numerical approximation of well-posed problems is convergent if and only if the scheme is stable and consistent \cite{Lax:1956}, thus relating consistency, stability and convergence. For a non-linear case a stronger criterion \textit{non-linear stability} is however required.

\subsection{Non-Linear Equations and Non-Linear Stability}

Up to this point we were focusing on the discretization of spatial derivatives of the ODE \ref{eq:theory:conservlawsode}, \textit{i.e.,} the operator $L^{\Delta}[u(t)]$, eluding mentioning the time discretization. The reason for that is an observation, that in the context of non-linear conservation laws, the former introduces a much larger error than the latter. However, for the discussion of non-linear stability and convergence, we must focus on both, introducing \textit{fully discrete} schemes.\\
In \cite{Kruzkov:1970}, it was shown, that there exist a one-parameter family of evolution operators $\{\mathcal{T}_{s\in\text{I\!R}_+}\}$. Its discrete from is $\{ T^{\Delta} _{k \Delta t} \}_{k\in\text{I\!N}}$ The $\mathcal{T}_t(u_0)$ yields a solution of \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws} at a time $t$, given the initial data $u_0$. Then, a scheme in its fully discrete form is $ u^{\Delta}(t+\Delta t) = T^{\Delta} _{\Delta t}[u^{\Delta}(t)]$. The choice of a single discretization parameter $\Delta$ is justified by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which connects time and space discretization that preserve stability. \\
In a fully discrete form, the consistency condition is $||\cdot||$, $||r^{\Delta}(t)||\rightarrow 0$ when $\Delta\rightarrow 0$ and linear stability requires $|||T^{\Delta}_{\Delta t}||| \leq C$ where $C$ is a constant. The Truncation error is $r^{\Delta}(t) = T^{\Delta}_{\Delta t}[u(t)] - \mathcal{T}_{\Delta t}[u(t)]$, where $u(t)$ is the exact solution to \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws}. \\

%% on the TV stability

Now we proceed with outlying how a numerical scheme can be constructed in a non-linear case. We start with a fundamental Lax-Wendroff theorem, \cite{Lax:1960}, that states that for a function $u$ to be a weak solution of \ref{eq:theory:conservlaws}, the numerically approximated solution $u^{\Delta}$ to the \ref{eq:theory:conservlawsode} obtained via conservative and consistent scheme, should converge strongly. Hence, once the condition for a scheme to be convergent is found, the Lax-Wendroff theorem assures that solution obtained via such a scheme is weak solution\footnote{However, the solution is not guaranteed to be entropic. For that the scheme has to also satisfy the entropy inequality.}. \\

A concept of convergence is related to a concept of bound variation (BV) invariance and compactness of bounded sets. The BV space is a space of all functions with finite total variation (TV) \cite{Luigi:2002}. It can be shown that if initial data belongs to a $\text{BV}(\text{I\!R}^d)$, then the solution $u \in \text{BV}(\text{I\!R}\times\text{I\!R}^d)$, for $t > 0$, $u(t) \in \text{BV}(\text{I\!R}^d)$, which constitutes the BV-invariance. This is however not necessarily the case for a system of cosnervation laws. See \textit{e.g.,} \cite{Chen:2006}. In addition, it can be shown that a given set of functions that belongs to BV, there exists a subset converging in the $L^1$-norm to a specific function \cite{Luigi:2002}. \\

Thus, if we have a numerical scheme that displays a behavior akin BF-invariance, the Lax-Wendroff Theorem assure that the it $L^1$ stable and consistent. Than, a solution obtained via such a scheme converges in $L^1$-nrom to a weak solution as $\Delta\rightarrow 0$. Such scheme is called \textit{TV-stable}. A particular class of schemes having this property is the \textit{total-variation diminishing} (TVD) schemes. Convergence in case non-linear conservation laws was first shown for \textit{monotone} schemes that if $u \geq \upsilon$ then $T_{s}^{\Delta}(u) \geq T_{s}^{\Delta}(\upsilon)$. And a scheme satisfies the strong stability condition if $\geq T_{s}^{\Delta}$ is conservative and monotone \cite{Crandall:1980proc}, and hence, it is TVD \cite{LeVeque:1992}.
