\chapter{Non-thermal emission from \ac{BNS} mergers} \label{ch:afterglow} 

In this chapter we discuss models of the non-thermal counterpart 
of the \ac{BNS} mergers, the \ac{kN} afterglow.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:intro:afterglow} we recall the origin of the non-thermal 
emission, and basic methods to calculate of the synchrotron 
radiation from an expanding into the \ac{ISM} \blast{}.
%
In Sec.~\ref{sec:afterglow:code} we discuss the novel 
code to compute the \ac{GRB} and \ac{kN} afterglows,
\pyblast{}. 
%
Finally, in Sec.~\ref{sec:afterglow:results} we apply \pyblast{} 
to the dynamical ejecta from our \ac{NR} 
\ac{BNS} merger simulations and investigate how the properties of the 
fast ejecta tail, discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:fast_de} affect the 
\ac{kN} afterglow and compare our models with recently observed rebrightening 
of \GRB{}.

%%%% -------------------------------------------------------

%Consider a moving source of radiation and an observer with a line of sight to the source.
%Let $\upsilon$, $\Gamma$ and $\theta$ be the source velocity, 
%\ac{LF} and angle with the line of sight.
%%
%Consider three frames of reference, the comoving frame (usually denoted with a prime $'$),
%the lab frame, where the source is seen as moving with $\upsilon$ and observer frame.
%Then, if two photons are emitted in the comoving frame with time difference of $\delta t'$,
%which is in the lab frame $\delta t = \Gamma \delta t'$, the observer sees the two 
%photons arrive with 
%%
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%%\delta t_{obs} &= \delta t + \frac{(d - \upsilon\cos(\theta) \delta t)}{c} - \frac{d}{c} \\
%%&= \delta t (1 - \upsilon \cos(\theta) / c) \\
%%&= \delta t' \Gamma (1 - \upsilon \cos(\theta) / c)\\
%%&= \delta t' \mathcal{D}^{-1}
%%\end{eqnarray}
%%
%$\delta t_{obs} = \delta t' \mathcal{D}^{-1}$
%%
%where $d$ is the distance to the source, and 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{D} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1 - (\upsilon/c) \cos(\theta))} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1 - \beta\cos(\theta))}
%\label{eq:afterglow:dop_fac}
%\end{equation}
%%
%is the \ac{DF}. 
%
%
%Next, we consider the transformation of the photon frequencies. 
%%
%The Lorentz transformation of the photon $4$-momentum in comoving frame, \eg,, 
%$\nu'(1, \cos(\theta'), \sin(\theta'),0)$ to the lab frame $4$-momentum 
%$\nu(1, \cos(\theta), \sin(\theta), 0)$
%%
%%\begin{equation}
%%\nu = \nu' \Gamma(1+\upsilon \cos(\theta')/c) \text{ \& } \nu\cos(\theta) = \nu' \Gamma (\cos(\theta') + \upsilon/c)
%%\end{equation}
%%%
%%or 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\nu = \frac{\nu'}{\Gamma (1 - \upsilon\cos(\theta)/c)} = \nu' / \mathcal{D}
%\label{eq:afterglow:dop_fac_freq}
%\end{equation}

%The robust way to model the \ac{GRB}/\ac{kN} afterglows is to perform 
%multidynamisional radiation \ac{HD} or \ac{MHD} studies. These, however, 
%are very numerically expensive, as the timescales for the problem range 
%from days to tens of years.
%
When computing the afterglow emission from the structured relativistic 
(mildly relativistic) source, several key components are required: 
(i) special relativistic effects (\eg, beaming and Doppler shift),
(ii) emission mechanism (\eg, \ac{IC}, synchrotron, cyclotron), 
and (iii) the dynamical evolution of the emitting matter over the 
relevant timescale. 

When talking about special relativistic effects, it is convenient 
to introduce the frame of reference comoving with the fluid (usually denoted with prime, $'$) 
and observer frame. 
For an element of the fluid moving with velocity, $\upsilon$, and \ac{LF}, 
$\Gamma$, at angle, $\theta$, from the line of sight, the Lorentz transformation 
reads 
%
\begin{equation}
\delta t_{obs} = \frac{\delta t'}{\mathcal{D}}, \hspace{3mm}
\mathcal{D} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1 - \beta\cos(\theta))}, \hspace{3mm}
\nu = \frac{\nu'}{\Gamma (1 - \upsilon\cos(\theta)/c)} = \nu' / \mathcal{D}\, ,
\label{eq:afterglow:dop_fac}
\end{equation}
%
where $\delta t_{obs}$ is the time interval between successively emitted photons, 
in observer frame, $\mathcal{D}$ is \ac{LF}, and $\nu=\nu'/\mathcal{D}$ is the 
classical Doppler shift formula for the frequency of the radiation.

%
%which is a standard Doppler shift formula.
%
%\subsubsection{Relativistic beaming of photons}
%
%%%% ---------------------------------------
%%%% --- On the Angular size of the source
%%%% ---------------------------------------
%
%We have shown that $\nu = \nu' \mathcal{D}$, but also 
%$\sin(\theta) = \sin(\theta')/\mathcal{D}$. Then the transverse component of the 
%momentum is invariant under the Lorentz transformation, \eg, 
%$\nu_{\perp}' = \nu'\sin(\theta') = \nu\sin(\theta) \nu_{\perp}$. 
%%
%For a beam of photons it implies that the angular size of the beam is smaller 
%in the lab frame than in the comoving frame by $\propto \Gamma$.
%%
%The solid angle of a conical beam of photons, $d\Gamma$ then 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%d\Gamma = \sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi = \sin(\theta') d\theta' d\phi' / \mathcal{D}^2 = d\Omega'/\mathcal{D}^2
%\end{equation}
%%
%is smaller in the lab frame than in the comoving frame.
%%
%Next, consider a frequency integrated total energy radiated per 
%unit time over the $4\pi$ steradians, denoted as $P$. 
%%
%The power in the lab frame $P = P'\Gamma\delta t'/(\Gamma\delta t') = P'$. 
%Hence, power radiated by particles is \magenta{Lorentz invariant}.

%%%% -------------------------------------------------------------
%%%% Transformation of specific luminosity and specific intensity
%%%% -------------------------------------------------------------
%
%Consider a spherically symmetric source, expanding with \ac{LF} $\Gamma$.
%%
%The \magenta{specific luminosity} is defined as the total energy that passes 
%through the surface enclosing the source per unit time, per unit frequency, 
%$L_{\nu} = dE / d\nu dt_{obs}$. 
%As $d\nu dt_{obs} = d\nu' dt'$ and $E=\Gamma E'$, the Lorentz transformation 
%of luminosity is
%%
%\begin{equation}
%L_{\nu} = \frac{dE}{d\nu dt_{obs}} = \Gamma \frac{dE'}{d\nu' dt'} = \Gamma L_{\nu}'
%\end{equation}
%%
%assuming that the $3$-momentum is zero (as the source is spherically symmetric).
%%
%The \magenta{specific intensity} is defined as a flux per unit frequency 
%and per unit solid angle, mediated by photons, traversing surface $dA$, 
%perpendicular to the conical beam, confining the photons, 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%I_{\nu} = \frac{dE}{d\nu dt_{obs} dA d\Omega}
%\end{equation}
%%
%that has a Lorentz transformation $I_{\nu} = \mathcal{D}^3 I_{\nu'}'$ 
%as $d\nu dt_{obs} dA$ is the Lorentz invariant.
%
%%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
%%%% Observed \ac{LC} from a source that is suddenly turned off
%%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
%
%
Thus, considering an extended emission source that is variable on a short 
timescale (a transient), the observed emission should be computed by integrating 
the emission from different parts of the source, accounting for their respective 
motion, angles and \acp{LF}. This is called the \ac{EATS} integration. For a spherical 
thin shell, described by $(r, \theta, \phi)$ coordinates, radiation emitted 
at $(r=\upsilon t, \theta,\phi)$ arrive at the observer with a time delay with 
respect to a photon emitted at $r=0$ of
%
\begin{equation}
t_{obs} = t - \frac{r \cos(\theta)}{c} = t\Big(1-\frac{\upsilon\cos(\theta)}{c}\Big) = \frac{t}{\Gamma\mathcal{D}}\, .
\label{eq:afterglow:tobs}
\end{equation}
%
Then, the total emission at a given, doppler shifted frequency, from the entire 
shell at the observer frame is obtained by integrated over all elements with the 
same $t_{obs}$.

%
%Now, consider the observed emission from the source at frequency $\nu$. 
%The starting time is $t_{0;obs}\approx(R_0 2 c \Gamma^2)$, \red{check!} 
%at which photons, emitted from $(R_0, 0, 0)$ arrive, At later times, 
%$t_{obs}>t_{0;obs}$, the observer still sees photons emitted when $r < R_0$. 
%%
%Assume that the intrinsic emission spectrum is $I_{\nu'}' = I'\nu^{'-\beta}$.
%Then, at $t_{obs} > t_{0;obs}$ the radiation from $\theta > \theta_t$ 
%(where $\theta_t$ corresponds to $t_{obs} = R_0 (1/\upsilon - \cos(\theta_t)/c)$) 
%reaches the observer.
%%
%The observed flux \eg, $f_{\nu} \propto \int I_{\nu} d\Omega$, has the following 
%Lorentz transformation 
%$f_{\nu}\propto\int_{\theta_t} d\theta \sin(\theta_t) \mathcal{D}^{-(3+\beta)}$.

%%%% ---------------------------
%%%% A More Regorous Derivation
%%%% ---------------------------
%Now, consider a more rigorous derivation of the transformation of the specific 
%flux in observer frame from relativistic source with comoving specific intensity 
%$I_{\nu'}'$ and spectrum $\propto \nu^{' -\beta}$
%%
%\begin{equation}
%f_{\nu}(t_{obs}) = \int d\Omega_{obs} I_{\nu} \cos(\theta_{obs}) = 2\pi \int d\theta_{obs} \frac{ I_{\nu'_0}' \nu_{0}^{'\beta}\sin(2\theta_{obs})[(1+z)\Gamma]^{-(3+\beta)} }{ 2\nu^{\beta} [ 1-\upsilon\cos(\theta + \theta_{obs}) / c ]^{3+\beta} }
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\nu_0 '$ is a frequency that lies on the power law segment of the spectrum for 
%$I_{\nu'}'$. The Lorentz transformation of the specific intensity was made above. 
%The factor $(1+z)^{3+\beta}$ accounts for the Redshift on the frequency. 
%%
%Assuming that $\sin(\theta)/d_{A} = \sin(\theta_{obs})/r$, the above integral writes 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%f_{\nu} \approx \frac{ 2\pi I' \nu' _0 \nu_{0}^{'\beta}\nu^{-\beta} }{[(1+z)\Gamma]^{3+\beta}} \Big( \frac{R_0}{d_A} \Big)^2 \int_{\theta_t}^{\pi / 2} d\theta \frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{(1-\upsilon\cos(\theta)/c)^{3+\beta}},
%\end{equation}
%where $\theta+\theta_{obs}$ in the denominator was replaced with $\theta$ as $\theta_{obs}\ll\theta$.
%The integral is simple to compute. Ir yields
%
%\begin{equation}
%f_{\nu}(t_{obs}) \propto (1 - \upsilon\cos(\theta_t)/c)^{-(2 + \beta)}\nu^{-\beta} \propto t_{obs}^{-(2+\beta)} \nu^{-\beta},
%\end{equation}
%%
%This equation shows, that the observed radiation does not immediately turns off 
%when the source switches off. The flux falls off rapidly with time and vanishes 
%when $\theta_t$ exceeds the angular size of the source $(\theta_j)$.
%
%
%The \ac{EATS} integration can be performed as follows.
%The expanding thin shell is composed of infinitesimal elements,
%each of which is evolved within its own $(d\phi, d\theta)$
%cell, center of which has coordinates $(\phi_c, \theta_c)$.
%%
%Then for each cell, the observational angle, $\mu$, is computed as 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%    \cos(\mu) = \sin(\alpha) \sin(\theta_c) \sin(\phi_c) 
%     + \cos(\alpha) \cos(\theta_c).
%\end{equation}
%%
%Then the radiation at time $t$ is observed if $t_{obs}$
%%
%\begin{equation}
%    t_{obs} = t_{lab} +\frac{r}{c}(1 - \cos{\mu})
%\end{equation}
%%
%where 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%    t_{lab} = \int \frac{1}{\beta c} dr
%\end{equation}
%%
%is the time measured in the laboratory frame of reference.
%%
%Then we interpolate the part of the dynamical evolution
%of the infinitesimal jet that corresponds to this $t_{obs}$,
%and emitted the radiation during this time.
%The flux, $F_i$, for a given Doppler-shifted frequency, 
%$\nu_{obs}'$, is then obtained for each infinitesimal segment.
%Integrating over the $F_i$ we obtain the total flux emitted by the 
%blast wave and observed at time $t_{obs}$

%% \subsection{Synchrotron radiation}
%%%% -----------------------

%Consider an electron moving in the magnetic field, perpendicular to the 
%field lines. Let $\gamma_e$, $\upsilon_e$ be the electron's \ac{LF} and 
%velocity and $B$ the magnetic field strength.
%%
%The electric field in the electron rest-frame is $E=\gamma_e \upsilon_e B /c$. 
%The electron acceleration in this field yields radiation, total power of which, 
%according to the Larmor's formula, 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{syn} = \frac{2q^4E^2}{3c^3m_e}=\frac{2q^4B^2\gamma_e^2\upsilon_e^2}{3c^5m_e^2} = \frac{\sigma_TB^2\gamma_e^2\upsilon_e^2}{4\pi c}
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\sigma_T = 8\pi q^4 / (3m_e^2c^4)$ is the Thompson cross section. 
%%
%The $P_{syn}$ is the Lorentz invariant 
%(as electric dipole radiation is Lorentz invariant).
%%
%Note, that for an isotropic pitch angle distribution, 
%the average power $\langle P_{syn} \rangle = (2/3)P_{syn}$.
%%
%The angular speed of the electron (\eg its Larmor frequency), is
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\omega_L = \frac{q B}{\gamma_e m_e c}
%\end{equation}
%%
%Within the magnetic field, an electron is moving on a spiral trajectory. 
%The relativistic beaming of emitted radiation leads to a distant observer 
%being able to see this radiation, only when the electron velocity vector is 
%within $\angle \sim \gamma_e^{-1}$ from the line of sight. Correspondingly, 
%only a fraction of orbital time, $t\sim1/(\pi\gamma_e)$, contributes to the 
%observed radiation, which appears as a repeated pulse. 
%The duration of this pulse is
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\delta t_{obs} \sim \frac{2}{\gamma_e \omega_L}\frac{1}{2\gamma_e^2}\sim \frac{m_e c}{q B \gamma_e^2}
%\end{equation}
%%
%where we used $\delta t' = \delta t / \gamma_e$. 
%%
%Then the characteristic frequency of the synchtrontron radiation is given 
%by an inverse of $\delta t$ and reads 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\omega_{syn} \sim \frac{q B \gamma_e^2}{m_e c} \text{ and } \nu_{syn} = \frac{\omega_{syn}}{2\pi} \sim \frac{q B \gamma_e^2}{2\pi m_e c}
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\nu_{syn}$ is the cyclic frequency.
%%
%Note that here the factor $(3/2)\sin(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the pitch 
%angle between the electron's velocity and the magnetic field is \red{ommited}.
%%
%The synchrotron spectrum peaks at $\sim \nu_{syn}$. At $\nu < \nu_{syn}$ the
%$P_{syn}(\nu)\propto\nu^{1/3}$ (which is determined by the Fourier transform of 
%the synchrotron pulse profile). At $\nu > \nu_{syn}$ the power decays exponentially. 
%See \citet{RybickiLightman:1985} for the calculation of synchrotron spectrum. 
%%
%The power per unit frequency at the peak of the spectrum is given 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{syn}(\nu_{syn}) \sim \frac{P_{syn}}{\nu_{syn}} \sim \frac{\sigma_T B m_e c^2}{2 q},
%\end{equation}
%
%%%% ------------------
%%%% Shortened
%%%% ------------------
%
The power of the synchrotron radiation, $P_{syn}$, emitted by an electron moving with 
the speed, $\upsilon_e$, corresponding to the \ac{LF}, $\gamma_e$, in the magnetic field, $B$, perpendicular 
to the field lines is given by the Larmor's formula.
%
As within the magnetic field, an electron is following the spiral trajectory,
the characteristic frequency of the synchtrontron radiation, $\nu_{syn}$, is given 
by the angular speed of the electron (\eg, its Larmor frequency).
%
The power per unit frequency at the peak, $P_{syn}(\nu_{syn})$, can be computed as 
\citep{RybickiLightman:1985}
%
\begin{equation}
P_{syn} = \frac{\sigma_TB^2\gamma_e^2\upsilon_e^2}{4\pi c}, 
\hspace{5mm} 
\nu_{syn} \sim \frac{q B \gamma_e^2}{2\pi m_e c},
\hspace{5mm}
P_{syn}(\nu_{syn}) \sim \frac{\sigma_T B m_e c^2}{2 q},
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma_T = 8\pi q^4 / (3m_e^2c^4)$ is the Thompson cross section.

%Now consider the distribution of electrons.
%Commonly adopted is the power-law distribution, $dn_e/d\gamma_e \propto \gamma_e^{-p}$, which results in emission spectrum $f_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-(p-1)/2}$,
%which is a consequence of 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%f_{\nu} = \int_{\gamma_{\nu}}^{\infty} d\gamma_e \frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e}P_{syn}(\nu) \propto \nu^{-(p-1)/2}
%\end{equation}
%%
%as $P_{syn}(\nu) \propto (\nu/\nu_{syn})^{1/3}$ for $\nu < \nu_{syn}$\red{where is this from?}.
%%
%Here
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\gamma_{\nu} \sim \Bigg(\frac{2\pi\nu m_e c}{qB}\Bigg)^{1/2}
%\end{equation}
%%
%is the minimum \ac{LF}, above which electrons contribute to the specific flux, 
%$f_{\nu}$ \red{why?} \gray{This seems to be an equation for $\nu = f(\gamma)$ 
%    inverted, -- so is the $\nu$ a critical frequency?
%}
%
%%%% ------------------
%%%% Shortened
%%%% ------------------
%
The synchrotron radiation spectrum, emitted by an ensemble of electrons that have a 
distribution function, $dn_e/d\gamma_e$ 
%(with $\gamma_e$ being the electron \ac{LF}), 
is given by convolving the distribution function with the power spectrum of a single 
electron, $P_{syn}(\nu)$, as 
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\nu} = \int_{\gamma_{\nu}}^{\infty} d\gamma_e \frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e}P_{syn}(\nu), 
%\propto \nu^{-(p-1)/2}
\label{eq:afterglow:sync_power}
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma_{\nu}$ is the minimum \ac{LF} above which electrons contribute to the 
specific flux.
%
%%%% ------------------------------------------------------
%%%% Effect of synchrotron cooling on electron distribution
%%%% ------------------------------------------------------
%
%Consider the effects of electrons cooling. 
%The characteristic frequency associated with it is $\nu_c$ and $\gamma_c$.
%Electrons with \ac{LF} $\gamma_e > \gamma_c$ can efficiently loose their energy to 
%synchrotron radiation. Then, after the time $t_0$, their $\gamma_e$ drops below 
%$\gamma_c$, 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%c^2 \frac{dm_e}{dt} \gamma_e = -\frac{\sigma_T}{6\pi} B^2 \gamma_e^2 c
%\end{equation}
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\gamma_c \sim \frac{6 \pi m_e c}{\sigma_T B^2 t_0}
%\end{equation}
%%
%The corresponding characteristic frequency is called the synchrotron cooling 
%frequency. 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\nu_c = \frac{3}{4\pi} \gamma_c^2 \frac{q B}{m_e c}
%\end{equation}
%%
%At $\nu_c$ the spectrum of the synchrotron radiation is changing, as electrons 
%with $\gamma_e > \gamma_c$, the effects of cooling modify the electron distribution. 
%%
%%
%Consider the continuity equation for electrons in the energy space 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\frac{d n_e}{d\gamma_e} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma_e}\Big[ \dot{\gamma_e}\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e} \Big] = S(\gamma_e)
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\dot{\gamma_e} = -\sigma_T B^2 \gamma_e^2 / (6\pi m_e c)$ is the rate at 
%which electron \ac{LF} changes due to losses, $S(\gamma_e)$ is the injection 
%rate of electrons into the system.
%%
%Assume that the minimum \ac{LF} of injected electrons is $\gamma_m$, \eg, 
%where $S(\gamma_e) = 0$ for $\gamma_e < \gamma_m$.
%Then if $\gamma_c < \gamma_e < \gamma_m$ the solution to the equation 
%$dn_{e}/d\gamma_e \propto \dot{\gamma_e}^{-1} \propto \gamma_e^{-2}$.
%%
%Then, for this electron distibution the synchrotron spectrum is 
%$f_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-1/2}$ 
%\footnote{If $B=f(t)$, then the distribution function for $\gamma_e$ 
%    evolves with time and is not a simple pwoer law with index $2$, see \citet{Uhm:2013gwa}.
%}
%%
%For $\gamma_e > \gamma_c > \gamma_m$, the solution to the equation is 
%$dn_e/d\gamma_e \propto \gamma_e^{-p-1}$ (assuming the constant $B$ field, 
%the steady state). Then the synchrotron spectrum reads $f_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-p/2}$.
%
%%%% ------------------
%%%% Shortened
%%%% ------------------
%
%Depending on their \ac{LF} and the magnetic field strength, electrons can loose 
%energy, cool, with different efficiency. For instance, if $\gamma_e > \gamma_c$,
%where $\gamma_c$ is a certain characteristic \ac{LF}, after a finite $t_0$, the 
%$\gamma_e$ will drops below $\gamma_c$, 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%c^2 \frac{dm_e}{dt} \gamma_e = -\frac{\sigma_T}{6\pi} B^2 \gamma_e^2 c 
%\, \rightarrow\, 
%\gamma_c \sim \frac{6 \pi m_e c}{\sigma_T B^2 t_0}, \,
%\nu_c = \frac{3}{4\pi} \gamma_c^2 \frac{q B}{m_e c}
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\nu_c$ is called cooling frequency. 
%%
%Thus, the synchrotorn spectrum differ for electrons with $\gamma_e > \gamma_c$.
%%
%Consider the continuity equation for electrons in the energy space 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\frac{d n_e}{d\gamma_e} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma_e}\Big[ \dot{\gamma_e}\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e} \Big] = S(\gamma_e)
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\dot{\gamma_e} = -\sigma_T B^2 \gamma_e^2 / (6\pi m_e c)$ is the rate at 
%which electron \ac{LF} changes due to losses, $S(\gamma_e)$ is the injection 
%rate of electrons into the system.
%%
%Consider steady-state solution $\partial_t/\partial t = 0$.
%%
%Assume that the minimum \ac{LF} of injected electrons is $\gamma_m$, \eg, 
%where $S(\gamma_e) = 0$ for $\gamma_e < \gamma_m$.
%%Then if $\gamma_c < \gamma_e < \gamma_m$ the solution to the equation 
%%$dn_{e}/d\gamma_e \propto \dot{\gamma_e}^{-1} \propto \gamma_e^{-2}$.
%%%
%%For $\gamma_e > \gamma_c > \gamma_m$, the solution to the equation is 
%%$dn_e/d\gamma_e \propto \gamma_e^{-p-1}$ (assuming the constant $B$ field, 
%%the steady state).
%%
%Then the electron distribution function then reads
%%
%\begin{equation}
%dn_e/d\gamma_e \propto 
%\begin{cases}
%\gamma_e^{-2} &\text{ if } \gamma_c < \gamma_e < \gamma_m, \\
%\gamma_e^{-p-1} &\text{ if } \gamma_e > \gamma_c > \gamma_m
%\end{cases}
%\label{eq:afterglow:elec_dist}
%\end{equation}
%%
%with the former usually referred as \textit{slow cooling} and the latter
%\textit{fast cooling} regimes.
%
%
%%%% ------------------
%%%% Shortened x2
%%%% ------------------
The electron distribution function, $dn/d\gamma_e$ can be obtained from 
the continuity equation for electrons in the energy space 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intro:electron_dist_cont_eq}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\frac{d n_e}{d\gamma_e} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma_e}\Big[ \dot{\gamma_e}\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e} \Big] = S(\gamma_e)\, ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot{\gamma_e} = -\sigma_T B^2 \gamma_e^2 / (6\pi m_e c)$ is the rate at 
which electron \ac{LF} changes due to energy losses, $S(\gamma_e)$ is the injection 
rate of electrons into the system.
%
Assuming that the injection of electrons is constant (steady-state solution,
$\partial_t = 0$), and has a minimum, $\gamma_m$, such that, 
$S(\gamma_e) = 0$ for $\gamma_e < \gamma_m$, the solutions to the Eq.~\eqref{eq:intro:electron_dist_cont_eq} reads 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e} \propto 
\begin{cases}
\gamma_e^{-2} &\text{ if } \gamma_c < \gamma_e < \gamma_m, \\
\gamma_e^{-p-1} &\text{ if } \gamma_e > \gamma_c > \gamma_m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:afterglow:elec_dist}
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma_c$ is the cooling \ac{LF}, above which electrons loose their 
energy to radiation efficiently over a certain characteristic time.
%
The $\gamma_c < \gamma_e < \gamma_m$ regime is usually referred as \textit{slow cooling} and $\gamma_e > \gamma_c > \gamma_m$ as \textit{fast cooling}.

%%%% Synchrotron self-absorption frequency
%%%% ------------------------------------------------------
%If the photon absorption by the inverse-synchrotron process is important, 
%another characteristic frequency, $\nu_a$, can be determined. Consider the

%\subsubsection{Maximum energy of synchrotron photons}
%%
%Consider a shock front. Scattering back and forth, particles within it accelerate 
%via the \magenta{first order Fermi process}, increasing their energy $\times 2$ times, 
%at every front of the shock.
%In order to determine what is the maximum energy a particle can reach consider the 
%following. A charged particle of mass $m$ accelerates while crossing the shock front 
%on a timescale $\sim$ Larmor time, $t'_L = mc\gamma/(qB')$, where primed quantities 
%are measured in the rest frame of the fluid and $\gamma$, \ac{LF} on a particle in 
%the frame, comoving with the shock. 
%%
%The particle can accelerate to $\gamma$ only if it losses less then half of its 
%energy to synchrotron emission in $t'_L$. Then 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{4 q^4 B^{'2}\gamma^2 t'_L}{9 m^2 c^3} < \frac{m c^2\gamma}{2} \text{ or } \nu\propto \frac{q B' \gamma^2}{2\pi m c} < \frac{9 m c^3}{16\pi q^2}

%Thut, for electron the maximum synchrotron photon energy is $\sim 50$~MeV and for 
%proton it is $\sim 100$~GeV in the shocked fluid comoving frame. \red{assuming

%\subsubsection{Inverse-Compton radiation}
%
%The \ac{IC} scattering is the scattering of photons by electrons of larger energy, resulting in increase in photon energy on average.
%%% ---
%Consider electrons with $\gamma_e$ and photons with frquency $\nu$. Let $h\nu\gamma_e \ll m_e c^2$. The average frequency of scattered photons then $\nu_s\sim\nu\gamma^2_e$.
%\gray{
%    This can be seen from considering the scattering in the rest frame of the electron.
%    Let the incident photon have frequency $\nu' \sim \nu\gamma_e$. (See eq.for Doppler Shift). If $h\nu'\ll m_e c^2$, the scattering is elastic (electron recoil is negligible) and the post-scattering angle distribution is a dipol function. 
%    Then, transforming the $\nu'$ into the original frame results in $\nu_s\sim\nu\gamma_e^2$.
%}
%
%%% Single electron, Radiation Field
%Consider a radiation field with photon density $u_{\gamma}$, and an electron moving through it. 
%Then, the power in \ac{IC}-scattered photons is (assuming $h\nu\gamma_e\ll m_e c^2$)
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{ic} \sim \sigma_T \int d\nu \frac{u_{\nu} c}{h\nu} h\nu\gamma_e^2 \sim \sigma_T u_{\gamma}\gamma^2_e c;
%\end{equation}
%
%where $u_{\nu}d\nu$ is the energy density in photons of frequency between $\nu$ and $\nu+d\nu$, such $\int d\nu u_{\nu} = u_{\gamma}$. From $P_{sync}$ (see eq.above.somewhere) and this equation $P_{sync}/P_{IC} \sim u_{B}/u_{\gamma}$, where $u_{B}- B^2 / 8\pi$.
%
%Now consider, that the radiation field is generated by the synchrotron process, \ie, photons are produced by and scattered on the same electrons (to typically much higher energies). This process is called \magenta{synchrotron-self-Compton} or \ac{SSC}.
%The relative importance of \ac{IC} process is specified by the Compton paramter $Y$ for a population of energetic electrons. 
%Consider an energy density in photons for synchrotron process
%
%\begin{equation}
%u_{\gamma} = \int dr \int d\gamma_e \frac{P_{syn}}{c}\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e} = \frac{\sigma_T (\delta R) B^2}{6\pi} \int d\gamma_e \gamma^2_e \frac{d n_e}{d\gamma_e} = \frac{\sigma (\delta R) n_e B^2}{6\pi}\langle\gamma_e^2\rangle
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\delta R$ is the radial width of the source, and 
%
%\begin{equation}
%\langle \gamma_c^2\rangle = \frac{1}{n_e} \int d\gamma_e \gamma_c^2\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e}.
%\end{equation}
%
%Invoking the formula \red{which} for the $u_{\gamma}$ for synchrotron radiation, the Compton parameter reads 
%
%\begin{equation}
%Y \sim P_{IC} / P_{syn} \text{ where } \tau_e = \sigma_T (\delta R) n_e
%\end{equation}
%
%is the optical depth of the source to Thompson scattering.
%
%\paragraph{IC spectrum.}
%
%In order to obtain IC radition spectrum, the seed photon spectrum is to be convolved with electron distribution \citep{RybickiLightman:1985}
%
%\begin{equation}
%f_{IC}(\nu_{IC}) \approx \frac{3\sigma_T (\delta_R)}{4} \int d\nu \frac{\nu_{IC}}{\nu^2}f_{syn}(\nu) \int \frac{d\gamma_e}{\gamma_e^2}\frac{dn_e}{d\gamma_e}F\big( \nu_{IC} / 4 \gamma_c^2\nu \big)
%\end{equation}
%
%where 
%
%\begin{equation}
%F(x) \approx \frac{2}{3}(1-x), \text{ and } x = \frac{\nu_{IC}}{4\gamma_e^2\nu}
%\end{equation}
%
%To qualitatively asses the spectrum, assume that the seed photon spectrum is a $\delta$-function around frequency $\nu_0$. Electron distribution is power law with index $p$.
%%% ---
%Consider the low energy side, where the spectrum is cut off at $\gamma_m$, is proportional to $\nu_{IC}$ for $\nu_{IC} < 4\gamma_m^2\nu_0$. Then, if \ac{SSA} is neglected, then the \ac{IC} spectrum at low energies is much steeper than the hardest synchrotron spectrum $\propto\nu^{1/3}$.
%Now, consider the high energy side, $\nu_{IC} > 4 \gamma_m^2\nu_0$. There, the \ac{IC} spectrum approaches $\propto \nu_{IC}^{-(p-1)/2}$, same as the synchrotron process spectrum.
%
%\paragraph{IC in Klein-Nishina regime}
%
%The assumed non-elastic scattering of photons is only valid as long as photon energy is lower then $m_e c^2$ in the comoving frame. When this condition is not longer valid, the electron recoil in the scattering can no longer be ignored. Additioanlly, the cross-section becomes smaller then $\sigma_T$ (decreasing with rising photon energy). 
%The electron recoil also leads the the change in upper limit of the scattered photon energy, $\sim m_e c^2 \gamma_e / 2$. See \citet{RybickiLightman:1985} for equations.

%%   \subsection{Dynamics}
%%%% ----------------------
%
%Consider a dynamics of a relativistic blast wave propagating through a \ac{CBM}. 
%Such scenario is a universal part of the \ac{GRB} theory, that can be treated  independently. Assume that such "fireball" has a \ac{LF} $\Gamma_0$ and a total
%"isotropic equivalent" energy $E$. The \ac{CBM} has a density profile described 
%by $n(R) = (A/m_p)R^{-k}$.
%%
%The theory of relativist shocks with applications to \ac{AGN} jets was developed 
%by \citep{Blandford:1976}. Later, the theory was successfully applied to \ac{GRB} 
%afterglows \citep{Costa:1997cg,vanParadijs:1997wr,Frail:1997qf}. 
%%
%Importantly, the power law behaviour of the afterglow \acp{LC} is naturally 
%reproduces the self-similar nature of the self-similar blast wave solution
%%
%%\red{here the physical understanding is emphasized, not the derivation}
%%
%Consider the reference frame comoving with the shocked fluid. Then, $\Gamma$ 
%is the \ac{LF} of this fluid with respect to the unshocked one. The density of 
%the unshocked fluid in this reference frame is $\Gamma n$, and its particles 
%are seen as streaming towards the shocked fluid with \ac{LF} $\Gamma$. Generally, 
%for unshocked fluid it is assumed that the thermal energy of its particles is 
%much lower than the rest mass, or in other words, that the \ac{CBM} is cold. 
%%
%Passing through the cold \ac{CBM}, shock front randomizes the particle, protons, 
%velocity vectors, raising their thermal energy to $\Gamma^2 m_p c^2$ 
%(while their \ac{LF} remains unchanged). 
%In the \red{lab frame the average energy of each down stream proton is $\Gamma^2 m_p c^2$, from which it follows that at radius $R$, the total energy in the shocked plasma }
%%
%\begin{equation}
%E \approx \frac{4\pi A R^{3-k}c^2 \Gamma^2}{3-k}
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $AR^{-k}$ is the density of the \ac{CBM} at radius $R$ and 
%$4\pi A R^{3-k}/ (3-k)$ is the total swept up mass.
%%
%From this equation the dynamic of a blast wave can be inferred. For instance, 
%assuming $E=\text{const}$, $k=0$ (uniform density in \ac{CBM}), the blast wave 
%\ac{LF} $\Gamma\propto R^{-3/2}$.
%%
%The radius from the \ac{CoE} at which $\Gamma = 1/2 \Gamma_0$, initial value, 
%when also $1/2 E_0$ is deposited into \ac{CBM}, is called the 
%\textit{deceleration radius}, $R_d$. 
%For the uniform \ac{CBM}, it is $R_d\propto E^{1/3} n^{-1/3} R_{0,2}^{-2/3}$.
%%
%Additionally, shock compresses the plasma. For \red{highly relativistc shocks}, the compression is $4\Gamma$, giving the density in the comoving frame $4 \Gamma n$.
%It also accelerates the inbound particles to a power-law distribution function. 
%Additionally, it amplifies the magnetic fields. 
%%
%Essentially, this is all that is required for computing the afterglow emission.
%%
%%
%%
%\red{Now consider a slightly more rigorous derivation of $R_d$ and compression ratio and entropy generation by the blast wave.}
%%
%Now, consider a relativistic shock propagating into a cold upstream medium.
%The evolution of physical properties of the shock is governed three conservation laws: 
%baryon number, $n' \Gamma c$, energy and momentum fluxes across the shock front. 
%The latter two are a embedded into the fluid energy momentum tensor 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%    T^{\mu\nu} = (\rho' c^2 + p') u^{\mu} u^{\nu} + p' g^{\mu\nu},
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\rho' c^2$ is the total energy density, $p'$ is the pressure 
%(in the plasma rest frame), $u^{\mu}$ is the $4$-velocity and $g^{\mu\nu}$ 
%is the metric tensor.
%%
%Through some magic the conservation equations mentioned above can be written as \citep{Blandford:1976,Rezzolla:2013} 
%%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\frac{e_2'}{n_2'} = (\gamma_{21} - 1)m_p c^2 \\
%\frac{n_2'}{n_1'} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}\gamma_{21} + 1}{\hat{\gamma}-1} \\
%\gamma_{1s}^2 = \frac{(\gamma_{21} + 1) [\hat{\gamma}(\gamma_{21}-1)+1]^2}{\hat{\gamma}(2-\hat{\gamma})(\gamma_{21}-1)+2}

%For $\Gamma\gg1$ that usually describes early stage of the \ac{GRB} afterglow

%%
%Then, $n_2'/n_1' = 3 ((4/3)\gamma_{21} + 1) = 4\gamma_{21} + 3 \approx 4\gamma_{21}$
%which implies that the downstream plasma is compressed with compression ratio
%$4\gamma_{21}$.
%%
%Similarly, approximating, the conservation equation 
%$\frac{e_2'}{n_2'} \approx \gamma_{21} m_p c^2$ and the last equation can be 
%simplified to $\gamma_{1s} \approx \sqrt{2} \gamma_{21}$, which implies that the 
%shock front travels faster then the downstream fluid.

%Next, consider the self-similar deceleration phase of the blast wave in the

%%
%\begin{equation}
%E = \frac{4 \pi }{3 } R^3 n m_p c^2 \Gamma^2 = \text{ const}

%%
%where $\Gamma = \gamma_{21}$ is the \ac{LF} of the blastwave with respect to the

%Note, that in the comoving frame the average proton thermal energy is 
%$m_p c^2 \Gamma$. In the lab frame it is $m_p c^2 \Gamma^2$.

%%
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma \propto R^{-3/2}

%%
%Now, consider the elapsed time in the observer frame.

%
%and obtain similar scaling relations.

%
%After some derivation 
%
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma\propto R^{(k-3)/2}\propto t_{obs}^{(k-3)/(8-2k)}

%
%And if $k=0$, the previously derived relation for constant density CBM follows.

%A particularly useful case is the \ac{CBM} filled with a free wind with constant mass loss rate $\dot{M}$ and wind speed $\upsilon_w$, that gives $\dot{M}=4\pi R^2 n \upsilon_w = \text{ const}$, or $n\propto R^{-k}$, \ie, the case of $k=2$ with $\Gamma\propto R^{-1/2}\propto t_{obs}^{-1/4}$.
%
%%%_______________________________________
%%% On the energy injection
%
%Now consider the case where the energy of the blast wave is continuously increasing. A possible physical scenario here is a long-lasting Poynting-flux dominated jet, feeding the fireball \gray{and suppressing the reverse shock}. 
%Then the energy of the outflow from the central engine has to be included into the energy equation of the blast wave
%
%\begin{equation}
%E_{tot} = E_0 + E_{inj}
%\end{equation}
%
%Consider a central engine with time dependent luminocity  $L(t) = L_0 (t_{obs}/t_0)^{-q}$. Then the energy equation reads
%
%\begin{equation}
%E_{tot} = E_0 + E_{inj} = E_0 + \int_{0}^{t_{obs}} L(t)dt = E_0 + \frac{L_0 t_0^q}{1-q}t_{obs}^{1-q}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $E_0$ is the initial energy of the blast wave and $E_{inj}$ is the injected energy into the blast wave from the central engine.
%
%Consider the case when energy injection increases with time noticeably, $q<1$.
%
%Then, when $E_{inj} \gg E_0$ for $q<1$, the blast wave scaling 
%
%\begin{equation}
%E_{tot} \sim E_{inj} \propto t_{obs}^{1-q}.
%\end{equation}
%
%and for the constant density \ac{CBM}, $\Gamma^2 R^3 \propto t_{obs}^{1-q}$ which eventually leads to $\Gamma\propto R^{-(2+q)/(4-2q)}\propto t_{obs}^{-(2+q)/8}$.
%
%And it is easy to see that if $q\rightarrow 1$, the 'no injection' case is resored.
%
%%%____________________________________
%%% Lorentz factor stratification of the ejecta as the Energy injection
%
%The energy can be added to the blast wave in a form of velocity stratified ejecta, when the wave decelerates, \eg,
%
%\begin{equation}
%E\propto \gamma^{1-s}\propto\Gamma^{1-s}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\gamma$ is the \ac{LF} of the ejecta and $\Gamma$ is the \ac{LF} of the blast wave.
%Here the effects of the reverse shock can also be neglected as energy injection comes when $\Gamma\sim\gamma$ \red{[How does this work in the Peer/Nava model?]}
%
%This method is equivalent to the long-lived central engine with time dependent luminosity (at least for the dynamics of the blast wave), and the coefficient $s$ can be expressed in terms of $q$ \cite{Zhang:2005fa}. 
%
%For a uniform density \ac{CBM} the scaling relation reads
%
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma\propto R^{-3/(1+s)}\propto t_{obs}^{-3/(7+s)}, \hspace{3mm} R\propto t_{obs}^{(1+s)/(7+s)}
%\end{equation}
%
%which then gives $s = (10-7q)/(2+q)$ and $q=(10-2s)/(7+s)$
%
%\red{The question is, can I add L(t) to the dE/dr of the Nava model and it is all?..}

A universal part of the afterglow theory is the dynamics of the \trans{} 
\blast{} propagating through the \ac{ISM}, that is also called "fireball".
%
The theory of relativist shocks with applications to \acp{AGN} jets was 
developed by \citet{Blandford:1976}. Later, the theory was successfully 
applied to \ac{GRB} afterglows \citep{Costa:1997cg,vanParadijs:1997wr,Frail:1997qf},
and \ac{kN} afterglows \citep[\eg][]{Nakar:2011cw,Hotokezaka:2015eja,Hotokezaka:2018gmo}.

%%
%Consider a \blast{} propagating though the cold \ac{CBM} with a power-law
%density profile, $n(R)$ with a \ac{LF} $\Gamma$.
%%
%The the total energy in the shocked plasma then is 
%$E \approx \frac{4\pi A R^{3-k}c^2 \Gamma^2}{3-k}$
%where $n(R) \propto AR^{-k}$ is the density of the \ac{CBM} at radius $R$ and 
%$4\pi A R^{3-k}/ (3-k)$ is the total swept up mass.
%%
%The conservation of the total energy governs the dynamics of the \blast{}. 
%The point at which the \ac{LF} and energy of the \blast{} decreases by half, and when 
%is referred to as \textit{deceleration radius}, $R_d$. \red{IS it?}.
%%
%Passing through the cold \ac{CBM}, shock front randomizes the velocity vectors,
%of particle, protons, raising their thermal energy, while their \ac{LF} remains
%unchanged. Additionally, shock compresses the plasma and accelerates the inbound 
%particles to a power-law distribution function, and amplifies the magnetic fields. 
%
Withing a shock front, particles are being scattered back and forth, and get accelerated 
via the first order Fermi process. This increases their energy ${\times}2$ 
times, at every front of the shock.
%
Given a relativistic shock propagating into a cold upstream medium, 
the evolution of physical properties of the shock is governed by three conservation
laws:  baryon number, $n' \Gamma c$, and energy and momentum fluxes across the shock front.
%
The latter two are a embedded into the fluid energy momentum tensor 
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:grhd}, and Eq.~\ref{eq:theory:tmunu_perf} there).
%
These equations can be written as \citep{Blandford:1976,Rezzolla:2013}

%% Neutrinos
%\ac{BNS} mergers are expected to be strong neutrino emitters, on par with \acp{CCSN}, if 
%the remnant suvives sufficiently long for trapped neutrinos to escape \cite{72}. However, 
%detection of this emission is limited to the events in our galaxy, where the merger rate is 
%once every $\mathcal{O}(10^4)\,$years.
%The IceCube and VERITAS facilities can detect GeV/TeV neutrinos and photons that might originate 
%in \ac{SGRB} jet or in the remnant magnetosphere \cite{130,131} if the source is up to 
%${\sim}10\,$Mpc away. The origin of this very high energy emission, however, is not fully 
%understood, and their detection would be a ``new messenger'' from \ac{BNS} mergers.

%% postmerger GWs
%A large amount of energy ${\lesssim}0.1\,\Msun\eqsim 2\times 10^{53}\,$erg is radiated 
%over the ${\sim}10-20\,$ms after merger in a form of kHz \acp{GW} \cite{107, 60}.
%While this emission is below the sensitivity of current generation facilities 
%\cite{97,132,80,133}, it bay be observed by $3$rd gen detectors for close enough events 
%\cite{57}. 
%The main peak of \pmerg{} \ac{GW} signal, $f_2$, \cite{132,133,134,135} was shown to 
%correlate with $R_{1.6}$ \cite{132,80}, (and not with \ac{NS} spin and \mr{} \cite{134,135}).
%A more tight constraints can be obtained on the $\kappa_2^T$ (or $\tilde{\Lambda}$) from 
%$f_2$ via the quasi-universal realtion \cite{80,56,57,58,136} 

%% Phase transition and GWs
%Notably, the \pmerg{} observations of $f_2$, that itself is set by the orbital frequency 
%that depends on the $k_2^T$ allows to constrain the low-density physics (fixing the $R_{1.6}$ 
%and $k_2^T$) \cite{44}. Thus, $f_2$, is almost independent on the merger remnant star 
%deformations (until the collapse), as the rate of angular momentum loss is correlate with the rate of binding energy loss to \acp{GW} \cite{56,107,135,20}. 
%This trend was also snown to be robust with the presence of the $2$nd order phase transition 
%after merger, that allows for na additional energy release and amplification of \acp{GW} signal 
%\cite{9}. This is not exactly the case if the $1$st order phase transition is present, that 
%leads to the remnant contraction on the dynamical timescale and instead of angular 
%velocity, it is angular momentum that is conserved, \cite{11}.
%This such a phase transition can be undetified as disagreement between the $k_2^T$ obtained 
%from the inspiral \acp{GW} and \pmerg{} \acp{GW} \cite{11} (assuming \ac{PC} did not 
%occur\cite{10}).


%\subsubsection{Mass Ejection, Kilonovae, and Nucleosynthesis}



%\ac{BNS} mergers result in ejection of material that can be observed, providing the 
%information of the merger dynamics and properties of the binary, and enrich the 
%\ac{ISM} with heavy \rproc{} elements \citep{Shibata:2019wef}. The quasi-thermal emission 
%associated with the decay of heavy \rproc{} elements is qusi-isotropic and thus have 
%higher changes to be observed \citep{Metzger:2019zeh}



%%%%% Ejecta
%%Generally, the ejecta is classified based on the timescale over which it occurs. 
%The \textit{dynamical ejecta} is generally divided into 
%the cold, low-$Y_e$, \textit{tidal}, produced by strong tidal torques at merger 
%and prominent in very assymetric binaries
%\citep{Rosswog:1998hy,Radice:2016dwd,Dietrich:2016hky},
%and shock-heated, high-$Y_e$, \textit{shocked}, produced 
%by the core \bnc{} induced shock waves, propagating through the \pmerg{} debris 
%\citep{Radice:2018pdn}. %Hotokezaka:2013b, Bauswein:2013yna, Sekiguchi:2016bjd, Dietrich:2016hky,
%%
%The ejecta mass and velocity, as estimated by \ac{NR} simulations, lie in 
%$(10^{-4}-10^{-2})\,\Msun$ and $(0.1-0.3)\,c$ respectively 
%\citep{Hotokezaka:2013b,Bauswein:2013yna,Sekiguchi:2016bjd,Radice:2018pdn}.
%% Depending on the binary \mr{} (that determins the relative controbutions of two
%%components of the dynamical ejecta The outcome of the \rproc{} in the dynamical ejecta is 
%%broadly consistent with the solar \rproc{} abundances.
%
%%%%% Secular ejecta
%On a longer, \textit{secular}, timescale additional matter is ejected in a form of 
%massive winds \citep{Lee:2009,Perego:2014fma,Fernandez:2015use,Siegel:2017nub,
%    Fujibayashi:2017puw,Fernandez:2018kax,Miller:2019dpt}, % & Nedora V, et al. Astrophys. J. 886:L30 (2019)
%that could could be more massive than dynamical one, liberating $(10-40)\%$ of the disk mass. 
%%according to the numerical simulations of the disk evolution 
%%(see \eg, \citet{Radice:2018xqa} for estimates). 
%Various mechanisms contribute to 
%the matter ejection, \eg, neutrino irradiation of the polar region, generating high-$Y_e$, 
%low-mass winds \citep{Perego:2014fma,Miller:2019dpt}; nuclear recombination in the outer 
%part of the disk (after it expanded due to viscous and thermal processes) that can eject 
%${\sim}(10-20)\%$ of the disk mass at ${\sim}0.1\,c$ \citep{Lee:2009,Fernandez:2015use,Fahlman:2018llv};
%and \ac{MHD} effects facilitating matter ejection \citep{Fujibayashi:2017puw,Radice:2018xqa}.
%% & 141 Nedora V, et al. Astrophys. J. 886:L30 (2019)
%
%%%%% Ejecta -> EM signal
%The \pmerg{} disk and remnant properties, and the lifetime of the latter, set by the 
%binary parameters and \ac{EOS} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:intro:remnant}) \citep{Radice:2018xqa,Perego:2019adq} 
%determine the properties of the secular ejecta and hence, the \ac{kN} signal 
%\citep[\eg][]{Radice:2018pdn}.
%%The disk mass dependency on the \ac{EOS} and the remnant lifetime was examined in \cite{72,70},
%%where it was pointed out that short-lived remnant is usually associated with less massive disk.
%Additionally, the presence of the remnant modifies the ejected material by means of 
%neutrino irradiation \citep{Fernandez:2015use}, providing a possibility to infer the nature of 
%the remnant from \ac{EM} observations. Modeling this process, however, requires very long-term 
%$3$D ab-initio \ac{BNS} merger simulations with complete physics, that are absent in presence.
%
%%%%% GW170817 EM signature
%\ac{EM} followup of \GW{} showed the presence of both blue and red \acp{kN}\footnote{
%    See, however, \citet{Waxman:2017sqv} for a different interpretation
%} \citep{Villar:2017wcc}.
%Simplified \ac{kN} fitting models suggest that former requires ${\sim}0.02\,\Msun$ of high-$Y_e$ 
%material ejected at ${\sim}0.25\,c$, and the latter requires ${\sim}0.04\,\Msun$ of low-$Y_e$ 
%material ejected at ${\sim}0.1\,c$. Due to its large mass, the red component is 
%generally thought to originate in secular ejecta with the contribution from the dynamical, while 
%the origin of the blue component is less clear. Specifically, the required amount of high-$Y_e$,
%material (that is somewhat lower if sophisticated radiation transport \ac{kN} models are considered),
%is in tension with the \ac{NR} \ac{BNS} merger simulations 
%\citep{Sekiguchi:2016bjd,Siegel:2019mlp,Perego:2017wtu,Kawaguchi:2018ptg}.
%Additional ejection mechanisms have been proposed to address the discrepancy, \eg, 
%magnetic effects prior to merger \citep{Metzger:2018qfl,Fernandez:2018kax,Radice:2018ghv}. 
%%\gray{spiral waves shocking the accretion 
%%    disk by a long-lived \ac{NS} remnant \cite{141 Nedora V, et al. Astrophys. J. 886:L30 (2019)}}. 
%Future observations and long-term multiphysics \ac{NR} models will undoubtedly shed more light on this tension \citep{Metzger:2018qfl}.
%
%%%%% Fast tail of the ejecta -- UV precourser
%\ac{NR} simulations show that within the velocity distribution of the dynamical ejecta, 
%there is ${\sim}(10^{-6}-10^{-5})\,\Msun$ of matter ejected at ${\sim}0.8\,c$ 
%\citep{Metzger:2014yda,Hotokezaka:2018gmo,Radice:2018pdn,Radice:2018ghv}, due to shocks launched 
%at core bounces \citep{Radice:2018pdn}.
%This matter is sufficiently fast to avoid the neutron capture on seed nuclei 
%%(see Sec.~\ref{sec:intro:nucleo}) 
%and will eventually undergo free-neutron decay, emitting 
%\ac{UV} radiation on a timescale of hours \citep{Metzger:2014yda}. 
%
%%%%% Synchrotron remnant
%%Expanding into the \ac{ISM}, \ac{BNS} merger ejecta generates shocks that amplify 
%%random magnetic fields and accelerates electrons that in turn emit non-thermal radiation 
%%via synchrotron mechanism (see Sec.~\ref{sec:intro:afterglows}). This \ac{kN} afterglow 
%%can be observed on a very long, 
%%moths to years, timescale \citep{Nakar:2011cw,Hotokezaka:2018gmo} and provide information 
%%about merger dynamics and ejecta properties quasi-independent of uncertainty in \rproc{} \nuc{} 
%%affecting the thermal, \ac{kN}, emission. 
%%%
%Since ${\sim}160\,$days after the merger the non-thermal emission from \GW{} have been 
%consistent with \ac{SGRB} afterglow. However, ${\simeq}1243\,$days after the merger, a 
%change in spectral and temporal behaviour of the afterglow was observed, one of the 
%possible explanations of which is the emergence of the \ac{kN} afterglow\footnote{
%    See however \citet{Troja:2021xsw} for the alternative explanation
%} \citep{Hajela:2021faz}.
%The exact nature of this change remains at present unclear. 















\section{\pyblast{}} \label{sec:afterglow:code}

\def\eq{\text{equation}}
\def\eqs{\text{equations}}

%We calculate the non-thermal 
%radiation arising from the dynamical ejecta propagating into the cold \ac{ISM} 
%with the semi-analytic code \texttt{PyBlastAfterglow}. 
%
We intiialize blast waves using the \ac{NR} ejecta angular and velocity profiles, 
discussed in %Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:fast_de}. 
%These take from of the 
%Initial data for the dynamical evolution is taken from the \ac{NR} ejecta 
%profiles for the mass as a function of energy and velocity, that is 
%are used to compute the kinetic energy distributions 
Ch.~\ref{ch:bns_sims} and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_vel_hist}.
%
Then, we compute the adiabatic radial expansion of the ejecta in 
the thin shell approximation at each polar angle using the kinetic 
energy distributions.
%
We adopt the \blast{} dynamics formalism from \citet{Nava:2013} that casts 
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:afterglow:blast} as a set of \acp{ODE} for the \blast{} \ac{LF},
swept-up mass and energy, that read respectively 
%
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:afterglow:odes_nava}
    \begin{align}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dR} &= -\frac{(\Gamma_{\rm eff} + 1)(\Gamma - 1) c^2\frac{dm}{dR} + \Gamma_{\rm eff}\frac{dE'_{\rm ad}}{dR}}{(M_0 + m) c^2 + E'_{\rm int}\frac{d\Gamma_{\rm eff}\rm }{d\Gamma}}, \\
    \frac{dE'_{\rm tot}}{dR} &= \frac{dE_{\rm sh}}{dR} + \frac{dE'_{\rm ad}}{dR} + \frac{dE'_{\rm rad}}{dR} \\
    \frac{dm}{dR} &= 2 \pi \rho (1 - \cos(\theta)) R^2;
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\Gamma$ is the \blast{} \ac{LF}, $R$ is its radius, 
$\Gamma_{\rm eff} = (\hat{\gamma})\Gamma^2-\hat{\gamma}+1 / \Gamma$ is the effective 
\ac{LF} (see \citet{Nava:2013}) where $\hat{\gamma}$ is the fluid adiabatic index, 
$E'_{\rm tot},\, E'_{\rm int}$ 
are the total, internal energies, respectively, $dE'_{\rm ad}\, dE'_{\rm rad}$ denote 
adiabatic and radiative losses, $M_0,\, \theta$ is the initial mass and opening angle
of the \blast{}, and $\rho$ is the \ac{ISM} density.
%
Eqs.~\ref{eq:afterglow:odes_nava} are then solved via 
explicit Runge-Kutta method of order $8(5,3)$ by \citet{Dormand:1980} (with stepsize control).
%
The effects of radiation losses, discussed in \citet{Nava:2013} and lateral 
spreading of the \blast{}, \citep[\eg][]{Granot:2012} are turned off,
\ie, $d E'_{\rm rad}/dR = d\theta / dR = 0$.
%
The adiabatic index, $\hat{\gamma}$, is computed from the approximation to the 
numerical study of the \trans{} fluid \citep{Service:1986}
%\citep[\eq~5 in][]{Service:1986} as a function 
%of normalized temperature \citep[\eq~11 in][]{Peer:2012}. 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\gamma} \approx (5 - 1.21937z &+ 0.18203z^2 - 0.96583z^3 + \\
2.32513z^4 &- 2.39332z 5 + 1.07136z^6)/3.
\end{eqnarray}
% 
where $z \approx T/(0.24 + T)$ with is the normalization temperature
\citep{Peer:2012}.
%
It smoothly connects the 
$\hat{\gamma}=4/3$ and $\hat{\gamma}=5/3$ regimes. 

We adopt a common assumption that a fixed fraction of the \blast{} 
energy, $E'_{\rm int},$ is being
deposited into the electrons, $\varepsilon_e$, and magnetic field, $\varepsilon_B$, 
\citep[\eg][]{Dermer:1997pv}. 
The injected electrons distribution function is Eq.~\eqref{eq:afterglow:elec_dist},
with $p$, the spectral index, being a free parameter.
%
We compute the characteristic \acp{LF}, $\gamma_c$ and $\gamma_m$ using the standard
prescriptions \citep[\eg][]{Dermer:2008ev}
%\citep[\eqs~A3 and A4 in][respectively]{Johannesson:2006zs}.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:afterglow:gmin_gc}
\gamma_{min} = \frac{p - 2}{p - 1}  \varepsilon_e (\Gamma - 1) , \hspace{5mm} \gamma_c = \frac{6 \pi m_e c }{\sigma_T \Gamma B^{'2} t_{\rm obs}}\, 
\end{equation}
%
where where $t_{obs} = \int \frac{dr}{\beta c}$ is the time in 
observer frame, $B'$ is the magnetic field strength.

%
The synchrotron emission in the comoving frame, Eq.~\eqref{eq:afterglow:sync_power}, for the slow and fast cooling 
regimes is approximated with the smooth broken power-law 
\citep{Johannesson:2006zs}
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    P'(\nu') &= P_{\rm max;\, f}' \Bigg[\Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_c'}\Big)^{-\kappa_1/3} + \Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_c '}\Big)^{\kappa_1/2}\Bigg]^{-1/\kappa_2} \Bigg[1 + \Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_m '}\Big)^{(p-1)\kappa_2/2}\Bigg]^{-1/\kappa_2}, \\
    P'(\nu') &= P_{\rm max;\, s}' \Bigg[\Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_m'}\Big)^{-\kappa_1/3} + \Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_m '}\Big)^{\kappa_3(p-1)/2}\Bigg]^{-1/\kappa_3} \Bigg[1 + \Big(\frac{\nu'}{\nu_c '}\Big)^{((1-p)/2 + p/2)\kappa_4}\Bigg]^{-1/\kappa_4},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where $\nu_i ' = \chi_p \gamma_i^2 (3 B' / 4 \pi m_e c)$ 
are characteristic frequencies, and the 
maximum values for the power density
%
\begin{align}
P' _{\rm max;\, f} &= 2.234 \phi_p \frac{q_e^3 n' B'}{m_e c^2}, \\
P' _{\rm max;\, s} &= 11.17 \phi_p \frac{p-1}{3p-1}\frac{e^3 n' B'}{m_e c^2}.
\end{align}
%
The, $\phi_p$, $\chi_p$, and $\kappa_i$ are polynomials that 
describe the $p$-dependence \citep{Johannesson:2006zs}.

%\citep[\eqs~A2 and A6 in][respectively]{Johannesson:2006zs}, and the 
%the characteristic frequencies are obtained from the characteristic \acp{LF} 
%$\gamma_{m}$ and $\gamma_c$ via their \eq~A5.
%
%The synchrotron self-absorption is included via flux attenuation \citep[\eg][]{Dermer:2009}. %
%However, for the applications discussed in this paper, the self-absorption is not 
%relevant as the ejecta remains optically thin for the emission ${\geq3}\,$GHz 
%\citep[\eg][]{Piran:2012wd}.
%

The flux in the observer frame is obtained by itegrating over the \ac{EATS}, 
that are obtained by comping the $t_{obs}$, \ie, Eq.~\eqref{eq:afterglow:tobs} 
for each segment. The relativist effects are taken into account via 
Doppler factor, Eq.~\eqref{eq:afterglow:dop_fac}.
%See \citet{Salmonson:2003} for the detailed discussion of the method, 
%and \citet{Lamb:2018ohw,Fernandez:2021xce} for the recent implementations






\subsection{Method validation}

In order to validate the code we compare our synthetic \acp{LC} for \ac{NR} 
\ac{BNS} merger ejecta to those published in the literature. 
Specifically, we consider the code designed by \citet{Hotokezaka:2015eja},
and applied to the \ac{BNS} merger ejecta in \citet{Radice:2018pdn}.

        The vertical light green line marks the $\upsilon_{\text{ej}}=0.6$.
        The top panel shows that equal mass models have a more extend high energy tail,
        while the bottom panel shows that the angular distribution of the ejecta is not 
        uniform.
    } 
    \label{fig:afg_test}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:afg_test} we show the \ac{kN} afterglow \acp{LC} from 
Figure~$30$ and Figure~$31$ of \citet{Radice:2018pdn}. The plot shows that that 
two codes are in a good agreement. The discrepancies observed can be attributed 
for different physical treatment of the \blast{} dynamics and synchrotron radiation. 
Notably, considering the large uncertainties on microphysical parameters and 
ejecta properties (discussed below) these discrepancies can be neglected.

%Notably, since the largest part (in mass) of the ejecta is equatorial it eludes the 
%interaction with the \ac{GRB} collimated ejecta and expands into an unshocked \ac{ISM}.

In order to compute the \ac{kN} afterglow \acp{LC}, several free parameters of the model
need to be set. Specifically, we consider the \ac{ISM} density to be uniform with 
$\nism\in(10^{-3}, 10^{-2})\,\ccm$ \citep{Hajela:2019mjy}. 
The observational angle, (the angle between the line of sight and the polar axis of the 
\ac{BNS} system) is set to $\theta_{\text{obs}}=30\,$deg \citep{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa}.
The luminosity distance of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of \GW{} is  $41.3\times10^{6}\,$pc 
with the redshift $z=0.0099$ \citep{Hjorth:2017yza}.
%
The index of the electron energy distribution, $p$, and microphysical parameters are 
chosed based on the recent observations of \GRB{}, where the spectral evolution 
was detected \citep{Hajela:2021faz}.  
%(see however \citet{Troja:2021xsw}). 
%
We consider 
$\varepsilon_e\in(0.1, 0.2)$,
$\varepsilon_B\in(10^{-3}, 10^{-2})$, 
$p\in[2.05,2.15]$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:lightcurves} shows the \acp{LC} in X-ray and radio bands for several 
representative \ac{BNS} merger models together with latest \GRB{} observational data. 
%% --- lightcurve shape
We observe, that ejecta velocity and angular distribution defines primarily the shape of the \acp{LC}.
Specifically, broad velocity distribution (found in equal mass \ac{BNS} models 
with soft \ac{EOS}, \eg, SLy4 \ac{EOS}) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_vel_hist} 
translates into wide \acp{LC}, with an early rise time, comaptible with that of the early \GRB{} afterglow. 
This behaviour is guverned by the deceleration of the fastest ejecta shells, 
emission from which peak early. If the velocity distribution is rather narrow, with most of the 
material moving at ${\leq}0.2$~c (such is the model with LS220 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.43$) 
the \ac{LC} rise is steeper and occurs later (${\sim}10^2$~days after merger). 

%% --- general agreement with observations
Notably, the \ac{kN} afterglow \acp{LC} computed for most of our \ac{BNS} merger 
models are in good agreement with the 
rebrightening of the \GRB{} within the uncertainty introduced by microphsical 
parameters and \ac{ISM} density.
Specifically, this agreement is particularly good for models with moderately stiff 
\acp{EOS} and $1.00<q<1.82$, with respect to the \ac{LC} peak time.


From the \GRB{} model fitting the electron power law index $p$ is well constrain to $p=2.15$
\citep[\eg][]{Hajela:2019mjy}. The new emergent comonent in \GRB{} was found to have a lower 
$p=2.05$ \citep{Hajela:2021faz}. The effect of the decrease in $p$ is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:kn_afterglow}. Notably, the parameters $p$, $\varepsilon_e$. $\varepsilon_b$ and 
$\nism$ are very degenerate, meaining that the change of one can be offset by the change in 
another withing these parameters' ranges of credibility inferred for \GRB{}.

%% --- Peak FLUX --- [UPDATED] --- IN CASE IT IS NEEDED [ BUT WITH NO FIGURE ]
If we fix the \ac{ISM} density and microphysical parameters to 
$\nism=5\times10^{-3}$~\gcm, $\varepsilon_e=0.1$ and $\varepsilon_b=5\times10^{-3}$, 
we observe that the \ac{LC} peak flux, $F_{\nu;p}\,$, is the highest for 
for models with soft \acp{EOS} such as SLy4. 
In general, however, we do not find a strong dependency between the \ac{EOS} and $F_{\nu;p}$.
With respect to the \mr{} we find that for models with stiff \acp{EOS}, 
the larger the \mr{}, the smaller is the $F_{\nu;p}$. 
%
This behaviour can be attributed to the overall dependency of the ejecta mass-averaged 
velocity on the \mr{} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta:dyn:dsfits}).
As the mass-averaged velocity decreases when \mr{} increases, the 
kinetic energy budget of the fast ejecta of these models decreases. 
Slower, more massive ejecta have lower peak flux.
Notably, for the models with stiffer \acp{EOS} the dependency on \mr{} is not clear. 

%% --- UNCERTANTIES --- dominant --- microphysics 
%% It is however important to note that the \ac{LC} fluxes and the $F_{\nu,p}$ 
%% depend strongly on the shock michrophsyics. Within the error bars provided by 
%% \citet{Hajela:2019mjy}, they can vary by more then one order of magnitude.  
%% Additionally, the slope of the electron distribution, 
%% $p$, was shown to be lower for the emerging new component of \GRB{} afterglow 
%% (Hajela et al.~in prep). The change from $p=2.15$ to $p=2.05$ translates to the
%% inclrease in $F_{\nu,p}$ by $\sim2$.
%% --- uncertanties -- subdominat -- ejecta
We find that the the \ac{LC} shape and peak time do not depend strongly on the 
uncertain microphysical parameters and \ac{ISM} density. With respect to the latter, 
the peak time changes by a facter of a few when $\nism\in(10^{-3},10^{-2})\,\ccm$.
Finite resolution effects that are present in ejecta properties do affect the 
afterglow \acp{LC}. Specifically, the $t_p$ changes by a factor of 
${\leq2}$, and $F_{\nu;p}$ changes withing a factor of ${\leq4}$. However, 
our analysis shows that the uncertainty in $\nism,\,\varepsilon_e,\,\varepsilon_b$ and $p$ are larger. 
%% --- Robust feature
%% Specifically, the \ac{LC} shape and the peak time appear to be robust 
%% both with resolution and with microphysics, as they set by the dynamics 

%\section{Discussion}
%
%In this section we considered the synchrotron afterglow arising from the interaction 
%of \ac{DE} and \ac{ISM} for a set of \ac{NR} \ac{BNS} models. 
%%
%The recent observations of \GRB{} by Chandra, ${\sim}10^3$~days after the \GW{} event 
%showed the emergence of the rising flux component. Our analysis suggests that this 
%rebrightening can be attributed to the emergence of the \ac{kN} afterglow, as its 
%properties, such as time and flux are naturally reproduced by the \ac{kN} afterglow 
%from ab-initio \ac{NR} \ac{BNS} simulations.
%%
%In the analysis we evolved the \ac{DE} with semi-analytic code and computed its 
%synchrotron emission. 
%We found that the synthetic \acp{LC} are in agreement with the emerging new component 
%in the \GRB{} afterglow within the range of credibility of the microphisycal parameters 
%and of the \ac{ISM} density, $n_{\text{ISM}}$. 
%% The \ac{LC} shape and the time of the peak depends primarily on the 
%% ejecta velocity distribution. If massive fast ejecta component is present, the \ac{LC} 
%% is broader and peaks before $10^3$~days postmerger, while afterglow from 
%% the ejecta with small/absent fast tail peaks on the timescale of $>10^3$~days 
%% (see Fig.\ref{fig:lightcurves}). 

%% --- Note on the observations
%% The latest \GRB{} observations by Chandra \newtxt{(and possibly VLA)} 
%% at $1234$~days show a rising flux (Hajela \textit{et al.} (in prep.)). 

Comparing the \GRB{} observations and synthetic \acp{LC} we observe, that the 
rebrightening at $1243$~days after merger has the following implications:
the \ac{kN} afterglow peak should be (i) later and (ii) brighter than what is
currently observed. 
%
The condition (ii) is weak as the \ac{LC} peak flux is not well constrained due to 
uncertain microphysical parameters.
%% With respect to our models, the (ii) condition suggests that models soft \ac{EOS} and large \mr{} are disfavoured, 
%% as their $F_{\nu,p}$ is lower then the observations.
%% However, an increase in $\epsilon_B$ by a factor of $2$ changes this result.
The condition (i), however, is more robust from that point of view and allows to 
asses, afterglow from which models is more supported by observations.

%% --- PEAK TIME 
We show the peak time of the afterglow \acp{LC} of all our models in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:lightcurve_peaks}. There, the microphysical parameters and $\nism$ are fixed 
and listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:pars}, last row). 
We consider all models here, including those that do not have fast ejecta tail 
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:fast_de}) as their ejecta is still energetic enough 
to produce bright afterglow. 
%
The \ac{LC} peak times are ${\sim}10^3$~days for all models that do not undergo the 
tidal disruption. The latter, (BLh $q=1.82$ (\texttt{SR}) model) produces massive and 
slow ejecta that is characterized by the late afterglow \ac{LC} peak 
of ${\sim}10^4\,$days.
%
Overall, we observe that the $t_{p}<10^3$~days for models with $q\sim1$ and 
$t_p>10^3$~days for models with larger \mr{}. This relation appears more prominent for 
models with soft \acp{EOS}, as the ejecta in these models has a strong contribution from 
shocked, fast component of \ac{DE} (when \mr{} is small), and the 
kinetic energy of the ejecta fast tail increases with the contribution from the 
shocked component (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_v06}). 
And the afterglow of faster, less massive ejecta peaks earlier 
\citep[\eg][]{Hotokezaka:2015eja}.
Indeed, the time of the \ac{LC} peak depends primarily on the ejecta 
dynamics, the so-called deceleration time \citep[\eg][]{Piran:2012wd}.
%% --- 
%% In the Fig.~\ref{fig:lightcurve_peaks} we show the peak time, $t_{p}$, for each model, 
%% alongside the lower limit (the time of the latest observation).
%% --- 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:lightcurve_peaks} we also show the time of the latest observation 
of the rising flux in \GRB{} (horizontal line). This provides the lower limit on $t_p$
in accordance with (ii).
%
We observe that the synthetic \acp{LC} of models with 
moderate amount of fast ejecta, \eg, models with 
\acp{EOS} of mild stiffness and \mr{}, lie above the limit, while models with very 
energetic fast tails, found $q=1$ models with very stiff \acp{EOS}, peak earlier. 
%% ---

%%%% <<< moved to overall conclusion >>>
%The main conclusion of our work is that the observed rising flux in the afterglow of \GRB{} 
%at $10^3$~days can be explained by the \ac{kN} afterglow produced by ejecta in 
%ab-initio \ac{NR} \ac{BNS} simulations targeted to \GW{}. 
%%% ---
%Specifically, models with moderately stiff \acp{EOS} and moderately large \mr{}, 
%that produce a mild amount of fast ejecta, are favored.
%%% ---
%Out results are subjected to uncertainties, the dominant among which are introduced 
%by ill-constrained microphysical parameters. 
% Additionally, the systematic effects due to the finite resolution, neutrino treatment 
%and \acp{EOS} might be important. 
%%% ---
%A larger set of observations, that allows for a better assessment of shock microphysics, 
%and a larger sample of high resolution \ac{NR} simulations are required to investigate 
%these uncertainties further. We leave this to future works.
