Dear Sebastiano, 
thank you once again for giving me the feedback. 
I have adressed all the comments and suggestions you've 
given in the email as well as in the printed text.

Abstract is important.

TODO I added the abstract

TODO I added the required page

I've rewritten the introduction chapter. I moved the equations 
into their respective chapters.

I significatly shortened the GRHD part of the chap.2.
I moved Appenidx on postprocessing into the chapter as well as 
the table with simulations.

As Chap.1 has been rewritten the Chap.1 I removed repetitions. 
I addressed the ejecta origin part. 
I introduced the subsection on the statistics on the dynamical ejecta. 
I was reluctened to to so in the first place, as this chapter is about our 
simulations.


 * Chap.4 

This might go, but want to re-read final version.

 * Chap.5

Should probably put here kN basic equations you have in intro.

* Chap.6

Should expand on basic equations, by moving here those in the intro and adding those important ones references from other papers.

* Chap.7

Can improve the text flow.

 * General

 - Typos, commas, use of articles need check
 - Some math symbols are wrong or unusual, change
 - Figures needs to be discussed in the order they are introduced
 - Some figs are really small with lot of white text around, they do not look good and are difficult to read
 - Long refs block are a problem for readability, reduce to relevant ones and/or use a different bibtex style
 - Need to balance Chap. lengths: results chapters are shorter than introduction (should be the other way around, or equally balanced)

Please provide an updated and complete version.

Also think about possible referees, I'll do the same. We should agree and few names and I should informally contact them for availability ("Would you be willing to be listed as a *possible* referee for..."). At submission you'll need to suggest their names, and the faculty will make a choice (could also be different from those you suggested).
