\section{Used codes and setup}

\subsection{Initial Data}

The initial data is computer via pseudo-spectral code \texttt{Lorene} \citep{Gourgoulhon:2000nn}
The code generates the binary neutron stars in a qusi-circular orbit, that revolve only few times before merging.
The EOS for the minimum temperature slice of the EOS table used for the evolution assuming neutrino-less beta-equilibrium.
Assuming constant temperature, we also remove the photon energy contribution to the pressure.

In the evolution code, passing the initial data, the mapping is done from the zero tem
In the evolution code, the electron fraction is set by the beta equilibrium condition. 
The specific internal energy is reset in accoradance with minimum temperature slice of the EOS table used for evolution.

Errors present in the initial data in introduced during the mapping result in a small oscillations of netron stars.
In terms of relative changes in central density these amounts to $\sim2-3\%$ \cite{Radice:2018pdn}

\subsection{WhiskyTHC}

\texttt{WhiskyTHC} is ...
\cite{Radice:2012cu,Radice:2013xpa,Radice:2013hxh,Radice:2015nva}


\subsubsection{Hydrodynamics}

The code evolves the proton and neutron number densities, $n_n$ and $n_p$
respectively, as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wthc:pndens}
\nabla_\nu (n_p u^\mu) = R_p^\mu \ \ , \ \ 
\nabla_\nu (n_n u^\mu) = R_n^\mu \ .
\end{equation}

Here $u^{\mu}$ is the fluid four-velocity, $R_p = -R_n$ is the net
lepton number deposition rate due to the absorption and emission of neutrinos 
and antineutrinos (\red{see Section XXX})

The number densities are related as $n_p=Y_e n$ where $n = n_p + n_e$ is the baryon 
number density and $Y_e$ is electron fraction.

The matter of a neutron star is approximated with ideal fluid with stress-energy tensor

\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu} = \rho h u_{\mu} u_{\nu} + Pg_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

where $\rho=m_{\text{b}} n$ is the baryon rest-mass density, 
$n$ the baryon number density, $m_{\text{b}} \simeq 10^{-24}\,$g 
the neutron mass, 
$h=1+\epsilon + P/\rho$ the specific enthalpy, 
$\epsilon$ the specific internal energy (energy density),
and $P$ is pressure

The Euler equation for balance of energy and momentum reads

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wthc:euler}
\nabla_\nu T^{\mu\nu} = Q u^\mu \ ,
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is the net energy deposition rate doe to absorption
and emission of neutrinos (\red{see Section XXX})

\subsubsection{Numerical methods}

High resolution shock capturing methods are used to discritize equations 
\eqref{eq:wthc:euler} and \eqref{eq:wthc:pndens}.
Specifically, central Kurganov-Tadmor type scheme \cite{Kurganov:2000} with 
HLLE flux formula \cite{Einfeldt:1988}
and non-oscillatory reconstruction of the primitive variables with the MP5 scheme of
\cite{Suresh:1997}.

Shock capturing schemes require the presence of a low density atmosphere around neutron stars.
The constant value of $\rho_0 = m_p n \approx 6\times 10^4$~\gcm.

The rest-mass consirvation in the presence of artificial atmosphere is assured via 
positivity-preserving limiter from \cite{Radice:2013xpa}

The local number densities of neutrons and protons separately, are assured via 
multi-fluid advection method of \cite{Plewa:1998nma}

The outflow properties are extracted when the density exceeds the atmosphere density
by several orders of magnitude.

%% Spacetime evolution
The spacetime is evolved using the Z4c formulation of Einstein's equations
\cite{Bernuzzi:2009ex,Hilditch:2012fp} as implemented in the \texttt{CTGamma} code
\cite{Pollney:2009yz,Reisswig:2013sqa} which is part of the \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} 
\cite{Loffler:2011ay}.

The non-linear stability of evolution is assured via Kreiss-Oliger dissipation. 
The spacial discritisation is done via fourth-order finite-differencing implemented in \texttt{CTGamma}.

The method of lines, MOL, couples the space-time evolution and hydrodynamics. 

Time integrator of choice is strongly-stability preserving third-order Runge-Kutta scheme \cite{Gottlieb:2009}.
The timestep is regulated by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, that required CFL factor 
to be $<0.25$ for numerical stability. To assure taht the positivity-preserving limiter implemented in \texttt{WhiskyTHC} maintains the density positive, the CFL factor is set to $0.15$.

\subsubsection{AMR}

The code uses the Berger-Oliger conservative adaptive mesh renement (AMR) \cite{Berger:1984} with 
sub-cycling in time and \red{refluxing (Davids thesis does not have refluxing)} \cite{Berger:1989,Reisswig:2012nc} as provided by the \texttt{Carpet module} of the \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} 
\cite{Schnetter:2003rb}.

%% Leackage
The change in material composition ($Y_e$) is treated according to the leakage scheme \cite{Galeazzi:2013mia,Radice:2016dwd}. 
For other methods see \cite{vanRiper:1981mko,Ruffert:1995fs,Rosswog:2003rv,OConnor:2009iuz,Sekiguchi:2010ep,Neilsen:2014hha,Perego:2015agy,Ardevol-Pulpillo:2018btx}.
The scheme consideres three neutrino species: electron neutrino $\nu_e$, electron antineutrino $\bar{\nu}_e$ and an single species $\nu_x$ for heavy-lepton neutrinos.
The reactions traced by the scheme are listed in the table \ref{tab:leakage}.

Following the sources listed in the table, the neutrino production rate $R_{\nu}$ for $\nu\in\{\nu_e,\bar{\nu}_e,\nu_x\}$ are computed alongside the respective energy relase $Q_{\nu}$ and
opacities: $\kappa_{\nu;a}$ and $\kappa_{\nu;s}$ for absorption and scattering respectively.

Neutrinos are assumed to obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Their chemical potential is governed by the $\beta$-equilibrium with thermal neutrinos \cite{Rosswog:2003rv}

Additionally, there are two types of opacities, the density weighted opacities $\kappa_{\nu;a}^0$ and $\kappa_{\nu;s}^0$ and energy density weighted opacities $\kappa_{\nu;a}^1$ and $\kappa_{\nu;s}^1$. 
The former are related to the rate at which neutrinos escape the material, while the latter set the rate 
at which energy escapes the material as neutrinos escape \cite{Ruffert:1995fs}.

The optical depth, $\tau_{\nu}^{\alpha}$ is computed taking into account total neutrino opacities $\kappa_{\nu;a}^j + \kappa_{\nu;s}^j$ \cite{Neilsen:2014hha}.

Optical depth is then used to estimate the effective emission rates \cite{Ruffert:1995fs}

\begin{equation}
    R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}} = \frac{R_{\nu}}{1 + t_{\text{diff}}^0(t^0_{\text{loss}})^{-1}}
    \label{eq:method:whisky:Rnueff}
\end{equation}

whete $t_{\text{diff}}$ is the diffusion time

\begin{equation}
    t_{\text{diff}}^{0} = \mathcal{D}\frac{(\tau_{\nu}^0)^2}{\kappa_{\nu;a}^0 + \kappa_{\nu;s}^0}
\end{equation}

and the neutrino emission timescale 

\begin{equation}
    t_{\text{loss}}^0 = \frac{R_{\nu}}{n_{\nu}}
\end{equation}

and $n_{\nu}$ is the neutrino number density estimated based om the beta equilibrium with \red{(thermal?)} neutrinos.
The $\mathcal{D}$ is a tuning parameter set to $6$.

Similarly, the effective energy emission rate $Q_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}$ are computed with $\tau_{\nu}^1$, $\kappa_{\nu;a}^1$ and $\kappa_{\nu;s}^1$.

Further, the neutrinos are divided into two categories. 
The neutrinos that cannot escape, trapped, 
The neutrinos that escape according to the effective rate $R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}$,
with and average energy $U_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}/R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}$ are the free streaming neutrinos $n_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}$. 
These neutrinos are treated afterwards according to the M0 scheme \cite{Radice:2016dwd}.

The rest are the trapped neutrinos. Their effect on the pressure is neglected as it was shown to be weak 
in the NS conditions \cite{Galeazzi:2013mia}.

%% M0 scheme
In the M0 scheme the evolution of the number density of free steaming neutrinos is done under the assumption.
Neutrons are assumed to be moving along the radial null rays with four vector $k^{\alpha}$. The vector is normalized such that $k^{\alpha}u_{\alpha}=-1$. 
Then the number density of the free neutrinos in the fluid rest frame $n_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}$ follows \cite{Radice:2016dwd}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:method:whisky:eq7}
    \nabla_{\alpha}[n_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}k^{\alpha}] = R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}} - \kappa_{\nu;a}^{\text{eff}}n_{\nu}^{\text{fs}},
\end{equation}

where $R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}$ is the effective luminosity (\red{emission }) \eqref{eq:method:whisky:Rnueff}. 
The effective absorption rate then

\begin{equation}
    \kappa_{\nu,a}^{\text{eff}} = e^{-\tau_{\nu}^0}\Big( \frac{E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}}{E_{\nu}^{\beta}} \Big)^2 \kappa_{\nu,a}^0.
\end{equation}

where $E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}$ is the average energy of the free-streaming neutrinos, and 
$E_{\nu}^{\beta}$ is the average energy on the neutrinos that are in $\beta$-equilibrium.
$E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}$ and $E_{\nu}^{\beta}$ are defined in the restframe of the fluid.

The energy of the free-sctreaming neutrinos is computed assuming the \red{stationarity of the metric}.
Having the $\partial_t$ killing vector thus allows to have $p_{\nu}^{\alpha}(\partial_t)_{\alpha}$ conserved, 
where $p_{\nu}^{\alpha}$ is the neutrinos four-momentum.

Then, the average energy density of free-streaming neutirions obays

\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:method:whisky:eq9}
    k^t\partial_t(E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}\chi) + k^{r}\partial_r(E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}\chi) = \frac{\chi}{n_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}}(Q_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}-E_{\nu}^{\text{fs}}R_{\nu}^{\text{eff}}),
\end{equation}

where $\chi=-k^{\alpha}(\partial_t)_{\alpha}$.

%% Coupling, neutrinos and hydro
The coupling between the matter and neutirnos is done via operator split approach \cite{Radice:2016dwd}.
For equation \eqref{eq:wthc:pndens} reads

\begin{equation}
    R_p = (\kappa_{\nu_e;a}^{\text{eff}}n_{\nu_e}^{\text{fs}} - \kappa_{\bar{\nu}_e;a}^{\text{eff}}n_{\bar{\nu}_e}^{\text{fs}}) - (R_{\nu_e}^{\text{eff}} - R_{\bar{\nu}_e}^{\text{eff}}).
\end{equation}

For the Euler equation \eqref{eq:wthc:euler} reads

\begin{equation}
    Q = (\kappa_{\nu_e;a}^{\text{eff}}n_{\nu_e}^{\text{fs}}E_{\nu_e} + 
    \kappa_{\bar{\nu}_e;a}^{\text{eff}}n_{\bar{\nu}_e}^{\text{fs}}E_{\bar{\nu}_e}) - 
    (Q_{\nu_e}^{\text{eff}} + Q_{\bar{\nu}_e}^{\text{eff}} + Q_{\nu_x}^{\text{eff}}).
\end{equation}

The M0 scheme of \cite{Radice:2016dwd}, while less complex then frequency-integrated M1 schemes used by 
\cite{Sekiguchi:2015dma} and \cite{Foucart:2015vpa}, it is advantagous with respect to the computational efficiency.
It also includes approximations of the Doppler and gravitaional effects. 
Additionally, the unphysical radaition shocks above the merger remnant, that commonly present in M1 schemes \cite{Foucart:2018gis}, do not develop in M0 scheme.


\subsubsection{Viscosity}

Large scale magnetic fields are of prime importance for studying the emergence of magnetically and reconnection driven outflows and collimated jets postmerger \cite{Rezzolla:2011da,Bucciantini:2011kx,Siegel:2014ita,Ruiz:2016rai,Metzger:2018uni}.

Additionally, \gray{global} magnetic fields and caused by them magnetic stresses are important for the self-consistent treatment of the angular momentum transport in the merger remnant \cite{Duez:2006qe,Kiuchi:2014hja,Guilet:2016sqd,Kiuchi:2017zzg}.

Such effects are studied with high-resolution general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations.

The code that we employ, \texttt{WhiskyTHC} does not have magnetic fields. 
However, the possible effects that angular momentum transport might have on the simulation evolution
can be investigated via an inclusion of \textit{effective viscosity}.
This method has been shown to reproduce main features of MHD dynamics with application to post-merger accretion
disks \cite{Fernandez:2018kax}.

%% Method 
To account for the effect of subgrid-scale turbulent angular momentum transport, 
the general-relativistic large eddy simulations method (GRLES; \cite{Radice:2017zta}) is employed.

The stress-energy tensor of the fluid $T^{\mu\nu}$ is decomposed as 

\begin{equation}
    T_{\mu\nu} = En_{\mu}n_{\nu} + S_{\mu}n_{\nu} + S_{\nu}n_{\mu} + S_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

where the first term of the RHS is the familiar 

\begin{equation}
    E = T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}n^{\nu} = \rho h W^2 - p
\end{equation}

and the second 

\begin{eqnarray}
    & S_{\mu} = -\gamma_{\mu\alpha}n_{\beta}T^{\alpha\beta} = \rho h W^2 \upsilon_{\mu} \\
    & S_{\mu\nu} = \gamma_{\mu\alpha}\gamma_{\mu\beta}T^{\alpha\beta} = S_{\mu}\upsilon_{\nu} + p \gamma_{\mu\nu} + \tau_{\mu\nu}
\end{eqnarray}

where $n_{\mu}$ is the normal to the space-like slice hyper-surface, while $\gamma_{\mu\nu}$ is the spatianl metric, $\upsilon^{\mu}$ is the three velocity and $W$ is the Lorentz factor. 
The $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ is a purely spatial tensor representing the effect of the subgrid turbulence. 
It reads \cite{Radice:2017zta}

\begin{equation}
    \tau_{ij} = -2\nu_T(\rho + p)W^2 \Big[ \frac{1}{2}(D_i\upsilon_j + D_j\upsilon_i) - \frac{1}{3}D_k\upsilon^k\gamma_{ij} \Big]
\end{equation}

where $\nu_T = l_{\text{mix}}c_s$ is the turbulent viscosity, $c_s$ is the sound speed.
The $D_i$ here are the \red{covariant derivatives compatible with spatial metric}. 

The parameter $l_{\text{mix}}$ is a free parameter that can be varied to study the impact of the turbulence
on the results. \red{Alternatively it cen be set as a function of density. See Radice Paper}

Notably, in the context of accretion disks, the turbulent viscosity is typically linked to the dinensionless constant 
$\alpha$ (so called $\alpha$-viscosity???) that is realted to the mixing length as 

\begin{equation}
    l_{\text{mix}} = \alpha c_s \Omega^{-1}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the fluid \cite{Shakura:1972te}.

The value of $l_{\text{mix}}$ can be constrained by very high resolution GRMHD simulations with seed magnetic field
stron enough that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is resolved. Such simulation was recently performed by 
 \cite{Kiuchi:2017zzg}. Thus study yielded the $\alpha$ values for various density shells.
Together with the $c_s$ and $\Omega$, form \red{our} simulations, the $l_{\text{mix}}\in(0,30)$~m \cite{Radice:2018pdn}

Additionally, the $l_{\text{mix}})$ can be computed from ....

In out models the $l_{\text{mix}}\in(0,30)$ is computed according to \red{New Radice Ppaer}

%% Method for inculding the Viscosity term.
The direct application of finite volume Godunov-type methods to discretize the stress-energy tensor 
that includes $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ would lead to the development of the \red{odd-even} decoupling instability \cite{Lowrie:2002}.
\texttt{WhiskyTHC} avoids this problem by discritizing the terms araising from the derivatives of $\tau_{\mu\nu}$
in a flux-conservative fashion via proper combination of left and right biased finite-differencing operators \cite{Radice:2018pdn}.


%% ======================================== EOS used
\section{EOS}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./figs/tov_mr.pdf}
    \caption{Mass-radius relations for the EOSs used in this work. 
        Markers along the sequences indicate the NSs smulated in this work.}  
    \label{fig:method:tov_mr}
\end{figure}

For our models we use $5$ microphysical equation of states, namely the 
DD2 \cite{Typel:2009sy,Hempel:2009mc}, 
BLh, \red{Fill Refs}
LS220, \cite{Lattimer:1991nc}
SFHo \cite{Steiner:2012rk} and 
SLy4. \red{Refs}
.

The maximum neutron star masses and radii that these EOS predict are in line with the current astrophysical constraints, 
\textit{e.g.,} LIGO/Virgo constrain on tidal deformability 
\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa,Abbott:2018wiz,De:2018uhw,Abbott:2018exr}

Specifically, the LS220 is based on the liquid droplet Skyrme model. It has a especially steep dependency of its symmetry 
energy on density.

The DD2 and SFHo are based on nuclear statistical equilibrium.
In these EOSs a finite volume correction coupled to a relativistic mean field theory for treating high-density nuclear matte. However, between these EOSs mean-field nuclear interactions have different parameterizations and values.

To characterize these EOS, that employs very different microphyscis and finite temperature properties and their relation to the electron fraction, we consider the TOV solutions, presented on the figure \ref{fig:method:tov_mr}.
The maximum mass of a non-rotating NS that these EOSs support are $2.06$, $2.06$, $2.42$ $None$ $None$ 
for SFHo, LS220, DD2, BLh and SLy4 respectively. The NS radii, $R_{1.4}$, then $11.9$, $12.7$, $13.2$ $\red{None}$ $\red{None}$, which 
in turn is related to the pressure at half saturation density \cite{Lattimer:2012nd}. Thus we adopt the following naming convention for EOS. Those that lead to a NS with smaller radii are called "softer" and those that lead to a NS with larger radii are referred to as "stiffer" EOS.

In \red{all?.. except BLh?} EOS the finite temeperature behaviour of EOSs is largely set by the nucleon effective mass.
Then, the smaller the effective mass, the higher the temperature (assuming that entropy is unchanged).
For LS220, the nucleon mass is its bare nucleon mass (for any density) \gray{so... $m_{N}^*=m_{N}$??}.
For SFHo, $m_N ^* / m_N = 0.76$ at saturation density.
For DD2 $m_N^*/m_N = 0.56$
For BLh $\red{None}$
For SLy4 $\red{None}$
where $m_{N}^*$ is the effective nucleon mass and $m_N$ is the bare nucleon mass.



\subsection{Setup}



The simulation domain is a cube of $3.024$~km each side, whose center is at the center of mass pf the binary.
The AMR structure has $7$ refinemnt levels, with the finest convering both compact objects during the inspiral and the remnant postmerger.

We consider several resolution setups. Low resolution (LR) simulations have $h=246$~m, standard resolution (SR) 
have $h=185$~m and high resolution (HR) $h=123$~m for the final refinemnt level.

In the simulations where the neutirno M0 scheme is included, it is switched on shortly before the merger. 
The equations \eqref{eq:method:whisky:eq7} and \eqref{eq:method:whisky:eq9} are solved on the uniform spherical grid
with radius $\approx 756$~km, and resolution $n_r\times n_{\theta}\times n_{\phi} = 3096 \times 32 \times 64$
grid points.

A subset of models discussed in this thesis include the effective treatment of viscosity. 

We consider \red{$33$} distinct binary with total masses $\red{[None,None]}$ and mass-ratio $q\in[1.00,1.82]$.
In all models the neutrino leackage plus M0 scheme. Most models were computed at at least two resolutions. 
Most our models also include the effect of subgrid turbulence, viscosity.
