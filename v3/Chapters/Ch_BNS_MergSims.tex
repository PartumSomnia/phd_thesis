In this chapter we discuss the \ac{BNS} merger simulations.
In section \red{XX} we descibe the simulation setup, in 
Sec.~\red{XXX} we discuss the overall dynamics of mergers which 
is followed by model detailed dynamics of the \red{xxxx}

%\subsubsection{TOV}

%To characterize these EOS, that employs very different microphyscis and finite temperature properties and their relation to the electron fraction, we consider the TOV solutions, presented on the figure \ref{fig:method:tov_mr}.
%The maximum mass of a non-rotating NS that these EOSs support are $2.06$, $2.06$, $2.42$ $None$ $None$ 
%for SFHo, LS220, DD2, BLh and SLy4 respectively. The NS radii, $R_{1.4}$, then $11.9$, $12.7$, $13.2$ $\red{None}$ $\red{None}$, which in turn is related to the pressure at half saturation density \cite{Lattimer:2012nd}. Thus we adopt the following naming convention for EOS. Those that lead to a NS with smaller radii are called "softer" and those that lead to a NS with larger radii are referred to as "stiffer" EOS.
%Among considered, the DD2 is the stiffest EOS, while SLy4 is the softest.

\section{Simulation Setup} \label{sec:bns_sims:setup}

%We perform the \ac{NR} \ac{BNS} merger simulations using the code \ac{WhiskyTHC}

\subsection{Initial Data}


We compute the irrotational \ac{BNS} configurations in quasi-circular orbit for 
each \ac{EOS} considered, \eg, SLy4, SFHo, LS220, BLh and DD2 \acp{EOS}.
The initial configuration is obtained via the pseudo-spectral code \texttt{Lorene} \citep{Gourgoulhon:2000nn}, 
that solves the general relativistic initial data problem \red{in what approximation? Thin sandwitch?}.
The initial separation (of the qusi-circular orbit) is chosen $\sim40$~km and that
 corresponds to $~2-3$ orbits before merger.
%
The \acp{EOS} tables used for the initial data computation are the minimum temperature slices
$(T\sim 0.5 - 0.1)$~MeV of the finite temperature \acp{EOS} tables used for the evolution.
The assumption of the neutrino-less beta-equilibrium is made.
At constant temperature, at lowest densities, the photon energy (radiation) is a dominant 
contribution to pressure. Thus, we substruct this contribution from the tables.
%
%In the evolution code, passing the initial data, the mapping is done from the zero temerature
In the evolution code, the electron fraction is set by the beta equilibrium condition. 
The specific internal energy is reset in accordance with minimum 
temperature slice of the \ac{EOS} table used for evolution.

%Errors present in the initial data in introduced during the mapping 
%result in a small oscillations of \acp{NS}.
%In terms of relative changes in central density these amounts to 
%$\sim2-3\%$ \citep{Radice:2018pdn}





\subsection{Evolution}

%In order to perform numerical simulations of fluid flow, accurate numerical codes are essencial. 
%Codes that flux-conservative finite-difference HRSC schemes offer a ciertain degree of simplicity, 
%while high-order finite volume schemes are more computationally expensive (as they require 
%solution of multiple Riemann problems at the interface between regions) \cite{Reisswig:2009us,Shu:2001rep} 
%as well as complex averaging and de-averaging procedures \cite{Tchekhovskoy:2007zn}.

The evolution of \ac{BNS} systems is performed with \wisky{} \ac{NR} code
 \citep{Radice:2013apa,Radice:2012cu,Radice:2013xpa,Radice:2013hxh,
    Radice:2015nva,Radice:2016dwd,Radice:2018pdn,Radice:2020ids}.
\wisky{} is a result of combination of two \texttt{Whisky} \citep{Baiotti:2004wn} and \texttt{THC}.
The \texttt{THC} part stands for the Templated-Hydrodynamics Code developed using the \texttt{Cactus} framework 
\citep{Goodale:2003}. 
In \texttt{THC}, the state-of-the-art flux-vector splitting scheme are employed . 
%The "templated" in the code name stands for a modern paradigm in C++ programming, the templated 
%programming, where a part of the code can be generated from the prescribed templates at 
%compiling time (\textit{e.g.,} \cite{Yang:2001})
%
%The \texttt{THC} has several primitive variable reconstruction schemes implemented, 
%such as MP5, classical monotonicity preserving \cite{Suresh:1997,Mignone:2010} the weighted 
%essentially non oscillatory (WENO) schemes WENO5 and WENO7 \cite{Liu:1994,Jiang:1996,Shu:1997} 
%and two bandwidth-optimized WENO schemes WENO3B and WENO4B \cite{Martin:2006,Taylor:2007}, 
%contracted for modeling the compressible turbulence. Note, that the number 
%in scheme name stands for a formal order of accuracy.
%
%High-order flux-vector splitting finite-differencing techniques came from 
%the former, while the module for the recovery of the primitive quantities as 
%well as the equation of state framework from the latter \cite{Galeazzi:2013mia}. 
%Tabulated temperature and composition dependent equation of states can be used.
%
\wisky{} solves the equations of \ac{GRHD} in conservation form using a \ac{FD} scheme. 
%
%% Spacetime evolution
The spacetime is evolved using the Z4c formulation of Einstein's equations
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:nr}) as implemented in the \texttt{CTGamma} code
\citep{Pollney:2009yz,Reisswig:2013sqa}
which is part of the \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} \citep{Loffler:2011ay}.
%
%\cite{Bernuzzi:2009ex,Hilditch:2012fp} as implemented in the \texttt{CTGamma} code
%\cite{Pollney:2009yz,Reisswig:2013sqa} which is part of the \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} 
%\cite{Loffler:2011ay}.
%
The non-linear stability of evolution is assured via Kreiss-Oliger dissipation. 
The spacial discritisation is done via fourth-order finite-differencing implemented in \texttt{CTGamma}.
%
%\red{tripple check the FD is used for space time evol and central FV method is for hydro}
The flux reconstruction is done in local-characteristic variables using the \ac{MP5} scheme.
% see \textit{e.g.,} \cite{Rezzolla:2013} \red{CHECK}.
%The space-time is evolved using the Z4c formulation (see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:nr}), 
%solved via \ac{FD} code publicly available through \texttt{Einstein Toolkit}, 
%\citep{McLachlan,Loffler:2011ay}.%\red{CHECK}.

%There, the central stencil is used throughout, and only terms associated with the advection along the 
%shift vector are treated using the upwinded by one grid point stencil. 
%The accuracy of the scheme is available at 6th and 8th order, while $4$th is commonly employed. 
%In addition, the fifth order Kreiss-Oliger style artificial dissipation \cite{Kreiss:1973} is 
%added to aid with non-linear stability. 
%

%\paragraph{Hydrodynamics}
The code solves continuity equations (Eq.~\eqref{eq:theory:contineq}) separately for 
protons and neutrinos, $n_n$ and $n_p$, with the \ac{RHS} prescribed by the 
lepton number deposition rate due to the absorption and emission of neutrinos 
and antineutrinos, $R_p^\mu$ and $R_n^\mu$, (with $R_p = -R_n$) 
from leakage plus M0 scheme (See~\ref{sec:theory:neut}).
%The code evolves the proton and neutron number densities, $n_n$ and $n_p$
%respectively, as 
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:wthc:pndens}
%\nabla_\nu (n_p u^\mu) = R_p^\mu \ \ , \ \ 
%\nabla_\nu (n_n u^\mu) = R_n^\mu \ .
%\end{equation}
%
%\gray{in Radice2016dwd it is $\nabla_{\alpha}(n_e u^{\alpha}) = R$}
%
%\gray{in Galezzi2013, for Whisky, the equations are separate for baryon and leptons: 
%$\nabla_{\alpha}(n_bu^{\alpha})=0$ and $\nabla_{\alpha}(n_eu^{\alpha})=N$, 
%where the $n_b$ and $n_e$ are the baryon and electron number densities respectively.}
%
%Here $u^{\mu}$ is the fluid four-velocity, $R_p = -R_n$ is the net
%lepton number deposition rate due to the absorption and emission of neutrinos 
%and antineutrinos (see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:neut})
%
%The $R_{p,n}$ is computed according to the neutrino M0 scheme (see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:neut})
%
The number densities are related as $n_p=Y_e n$ where $n = n_p + n_e$ is the baryon 
number density and $Y_e$ is electron fraction.
%
The matter of a neutron star is approximated with ideal fluid 
with stress-energy tensor Eq.~\eqref{eq:theory:tmunu_perf},
%
%\begin{equation}
%T_{\mu\nu} = \rho h u_{\mu} u_{\nu} + Pg_{\mu\nu}
%\end{equation}

%where $\rho=m_{\text{b}} n$ is the baryon rest-mass density, 
%$n$ the baryon number density, $m_{\text{b}} \simeq 10^{-24}\,$g 
%the neutron mass, 
%\gray{if Galezzi13 it is nucleon mass which is actrually related to the EOS.}
%$h=1+\epsilon + P/\rho$ the specific enthalpy, 
%$\epsilon$ the specific internal energy (energy density),
%and $P$ is \gray{total isotropic} pressure.

%Written in a covariant form, the Euler equation for balance of energy and momentum reads

The code solves the Euler equations (Eq.~\eqref{eq:theory:tmunu_eq_0}) 
with the \ac{RHS} given being $ Q u^{\mu}$
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:wthc:euler}
%\nabla_\nu T^{\mu\nu} = Q u^{\mu} \ ,
%\end{equation}
%
%\gray{in Radice2016dwd it is $\nabla_{\beta}T^{\alpha\beta}=\Psi^{\alpha}$
%    with $\Psi^{\alpha} = Q u^{\alpha}$.
%}
%\gray{In the Galezzi:2013 it is $\nabla_{\alpha}T^{\alpha\beta}=\Psi^{\beta}$.
%    There the $T^{\alpha\beta}$ accounts for the ordinary matter and for trappend 
%neutrinos and photons, but it does not include free-streaming neutrinos. Assumed to be 
%similar to the 'test-fluid' they are neglected in constracting RHS of the Eistein equations.
%}
%
where $Q$ is the net energy deposition rate due to absorption
and emission of neutrinos also treated with the M0 scheme  
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:neut}).
%\red{JUST PUT REFS TO THE EQs THAT ARE IN THE 'nuetrino' AND 'viscosity' sections}




%\subsection{Numerical methods}
The continuity and Euler equations are discretized via \ac{HRSC} schemes
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:num_meth}).
%
%\eqref{eq:wthc:euler} and \eqref{eq:wthc:pndens}.
Specifically, the code employs central \ac{KT} scheme \citep{Kurganov:2000} with 
\ac{HLLE} flux formula \citep{Einfeldt:1988} and non-oscillatory reconstruction 
of the primitive variables with the \ac{MP5} scheme of \citep{Suresh:1997}.
%
Shock capturing schemes require the presence of a low density atmosphere around neutron stars.
We assume the constant value of $\rho_0 = m_p n \approx 6\times 10^4$~\gcm.
%
The rest-mass consirvation in the presence of artificial atmosphere is assured via 
\ac{PPL} approach.
%
The local number densities of neutrons and protons separately, are assured via 
multi-fluid advection method of \citet{Plewa:1998nma}
%
The outflow properties are extracted when the density exceeds the atmosphere density
by several orders of magnitude.
%
The coupling between the spacetime and hydrodynamic evolution is achieved via 
\ac{MOL}.
%
Time integrator of choice is \ac{SSP} third-order Runge-Kutta scheme \citep{Gottlieb:2009}.
The timestep is regulated by the \ac{CFL} condition, that required \ac{CFL} factor 
to be $<0.25$ for numerical stability. 
To assure that the \ac{PPL} implemented in \texttt{WhiskyTHC} maintains 
the density positive, the \ac{CFL} factor is set to $0.15$.


%\subsection{AMR}
The code is build on the \texttt{Carpet} \ac{AMR} driver \citep{Schnetter:2003rb} from the 
\texttt{Cactus} computational toolkit \citep{Goodale:2003}, that incorporates
\texttt{Carpet} Berger-Oliger-style mesh refinement \citep{Berger:1989,Berger:1984} 
with sub-cycling in time and refluxing. %\textcolor{red}{in Thesis it is said, --
% no refluxing was done yet} 
%The code uses the Berger-Oliger conservative adaptive mesh renement (AMR) \cite{Berger:1984} 
%with sub-cycling in time and \red{refluxing (Davids thesis does not have refluxing)} 
%\cite{Berger:1989,Reisswig:2012nc} as provided by the \texttt{Carpet module} of the \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} 
%\cite{Schnetter:2003rb}.

%\subsection{Code General Setup}

\subsection{Geometry and resolution}

The simulation domain is a cube of $3.024$~km each side, 
whose center is at the center of mass of the binary.
The \ac{AMR} structure has $7$ refinement levels, with the finest 
covering both compact objects during the inspiral and the remnant \pmerg{}.
%
We consider several resolution setups: Low (LR), 
standard (SR) and high (HR) with the finest refinement level being 
$h=246$~m, $h=185$~m and $h=123$~m respectively.
%
In the simulations where the neutirno M0 scheme is included,
it is switched on shortly before the merger. 
%The equations \eqref{eq:method:whisky:eq7} and \eqref{eq:method:whisky:eq9} 
The Eqs.~\eqref{eq:theory:neut:balanseq} \eqref{eq:theory:neut:balanseq2}
and are solved on the uniform spherical grid with radius $\approx 756$~km, 
and resolution $n_r\times n_{\theta}\times n_{\phi} = 3096 \times 32 \times 64$
grid points.
%
A subset of models discussed in this thesis include the effective treatment of viscosity
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory:visc}). 

We consider $33$ distinct binary with total masses 
$\red{[None,None]}$ and mass-ratio $q\in[1.00,1.82]$.
In all models the neutrino leakage plus M0 scheme. 
Most models were computed at at least two resolutions.

\section{Postprocessing tools and methods}

In this section we discuss the methods used to analyze the simulation data,
focusing on the overall average quentities that can be used for comparisons 
of the remnant, disk and ejecta. 
%
For this we mainly use the mass-averaged quantities defined as 
%
\begin{equation}
\langle f \rangle = \frac{\sum_i f(m_i)m_i}{\sum_i m_i}
\end{equation}
%
where $m_i$ is the mass contained in the $i$-th bin.



\subsection{Disk \& Remnant}\label{sec:bns_sims:method:disk}

It is common to discuss the \pmerg{} state of the \ac{BNS} systems in terms of the remnant, 
a \ac{MNS} or a \ac{BH}, and a disk or torus surrounding it. 
%However there is not unified convention in how to define the disk and separate it from the former. 

A disk around a \ac{BH} is the matter outside the apparent horizon 
\citep[\eg]{Dietrich:2015iva,Dietrich:2016hky}. 
%However, owing to the disk accretion onto a \ac{BH}, the evaluation time is a 
%crucial parameter, and unfortunately is not consistent in the literature, 
%(\eg $\sim1$~ms in \citet{Dietrich:2015iva,Dietrich:2016hky} and $\sim30$~ms in \citet{Sekiguchi:2016bjd}).

A disk around a \ac{MNS} is more difficult to define. Commonly, the 
threshold $\rho\sim 10^{13}$~\gcm is assumed. The choice is motivated by studies that 
showed that the angular velocity profiles becomes approximately Keplerian at this point 
\citep[\eg][]{Shibata:2005ss,Shibata:2006nm,Hanauske:2016gia,Kastaun:2016elu}.
This convection was adopted in several recent works 
\citep{Radice:2018pdn,Kiuchi:2019lls,Vincent:2019kor}.
The extraction time here is also important, but less so, as we find that the accretion on the 
\ac{NS} is considerably slower.
%In the case where the remnant is a neutron star, the disk definition usually includes 
%the density cut. For instance, in \cite{Radice:2018pdn,Kiuchi:2019lls,Vincent:2019kor} 
%the disk is assumed to encompass the matter with $\rho < 10^{13}$~\gcm. 
%The threshold $\rho\sim 10^{13}$~\gcm corresponds to the point in the remnant where
%the angular velocity profiles becomes approximately Keplerian, 
%\citep[\eg][]{Shibata:2005ss,Shibata:2006nm,Hanauske:2016gia,Kastaun:2016elu}.
%The extraction time here is also important, but less so, as we find that the accretion 
%on the NS is considerably slower.
%
%Overall, we estimate that these differences can amount to a systematic factor of a few,
%which we employ for the statistical analysis in section \ref{sec:stat:anal}

% In this thesis we define the disk as a matter that satisfies two criteria 
%$\alpha > 0.15$ and $\tho < 10^{13}\gcm$, where $\alpha$ is the lapse function 
%(see section \ref{sec:theory:gr3p1}).

We compute the disk baryonic mass of the disks evaluating
the volume integral of the conserved rest-mass density $D=\sqrt{\gamma}~W\rho$,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:method:mdisk}
M_{\text{disk}} = \int D \dd^3 x
\end{equation}
%
from $3$D snapshots of the simulations.% in postprocessing.

%% In \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bjd}, the disk mass is extracted at
%% ${\approx} 30$~ms outside the AH. In \cite{Radice:2018pdn}, the disk mass is computed
%% as the baryonic mass outside the AH at BH formation, while for NS
%% remnants the criterion $\rho < 10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$ is used. 
%% In \cite{Kiuchi:2019lls} for both BH and NS outcome the $\rho < 10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$ 
%% criterion is used and time of the extraction is not specified. 
%% In \cite{Vincent:2019kor} the density criterion is the same, however the simulations 
%% are significantly shorter (${~\sim 7.5}$~ms) than in other
%% works. Overall, we estimate that these differences can amount to a
%% systematic factor of a few.



\subsection{Density modes} \label{sec:bns_sims:method:modes}

%% FROM THE LETTER 

The hydrodynamic instability in newly formed \acp{MNS} 
is monitored by a decomposition in Fourier modes
$e^{-\i m\phi}$ of the Eulerian rest-mass density on the equatorial plane 
[see Eq.~(1) of \citep{Radice:2016gym}] and characterized by the
development of a $m=2$ followed by a $m=1$ mode 
\citep{East:2015vix,Paschalidis:2015mla,Radice:2016gym,Lehner:2016wjg,Bernuzzi:2013rza,Kastaun:2014fna}.
%In the short-lived remnant (LS220) the $m=1$ mode
%is subdominant with respect to the $m=2$, and it reaches a maximum close to the collapse
%\citep{Bernuzzi:2013rza}. Instead, in the long-lived remnant (DD2) the $m=1$
%becomes the dominant mode at $\sim$20~ms and persists throughout the
%remnant's lifetime, while the $m=2$ efficiently dissipates via
%gravitational-wave emission \citep{Bernuzzi:2015opx,Radice:2016gym}.
%
%% FROM THE PAPER 
%
%During the post-merger evolution the neutron star oscillates the most prominant modes 
%are quasiradial mode $F$ ($m=0$), the $m=2$ $f$-model 
%and non-linear combinations of them \citep[\eg][]{Shibata:2000jt,Stergioulas:2011gd}.
%
%It has also been shown that the $m=1$, so-called one-armed spiral instability, 
%is present in the remnant of \ac{BNS} mergers  
%\citep{Paschalidis:2015mla,Radice:2016gym,East:2016zvv}.
%
%In order to investigate the dynamical instabilities in our simulations we 
%project the rest-mass density onto spherical harmonics,
%or, in other words, we perform the complex azimuthal mode decomposition of,
%the conserved rest-mass density.
For the data availability reasons we consider only $\rho(x,y,z=0,t)$, 
\ie restrict our analysis to the orbital plane $z=0$

%\red{DOUBLE check the presence of Gamma and W}

% where %% $\rho$ is the rest mass density, 
% $\gamma$ is the determinant of the three-metric and $W$ is the

We note that the above quantities are gauge dependent.
%
%\red{Dietrich in his thesis thinks that the growing m=1 mode is "We can not
%    exclude the possibility that the growing m = 1 mode is triggered by numerical effects,
%    but we think that it is a physical hydrodynamical effect due to mode couplings."
%    Page 53 of the thesis
%}
%
In addition, frequencies of the modes can be computed with the Fourier analysis 
of the $\rho_{\text{max}}$ and projections $C_{m}$. We resort it for the future work, 
as in this work we are interested only in their magnitude. 





\subsection{Angular momentum} \label{sec:bns_sims:method:ang_mom}

%\red{First, white that in GR the angular momentum is not clearly defined}

%% FROM LETTER 

%From the fluid's stress energy tensor,
%we compute the angular momentum density flux $J_r = T_{ra}(\partial_\phi)^a$,
%where $\phi$ is the cylindrical angular coordinate;
%angular momentum is conserved if $(\partial_\phi)^a$ is a Killing vector.
%
%% FROM PAPER 

The fluid's angular momentum analysis in the remnant and disk is performed
assuming axisymmetry,
%(see Appendix~\ref{app:ang} for derivation)
that is, we assume $\phi^{\mu} = (\partial_{\phi})^{\mu}$ is a Killing
vector. Accordingly, the conservation law (Eq.~\eqref{eq:theory:tmunu_eq_0}) 
reads
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t(T^{\mu\nu}\phi_{\nu}n_{\nu}\sqrt{\gamma}) -
\partial_i(\alpha T^{i \nu}\phi_{\nu}\sqrt{\gamma}) = 0 \ ,
\end{equation}
%
where $n^\mu$ is the normal vector to the spacelike hypersurfaces of
the spacetime's $3+1$ decomposition.
%
The equation implies the conservation of the angular momentum 
\begin{equation}
J = % \int j dV = 
%- \int \, T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}\phi^{\nu}\,\dd ^3x = 
-\int \,
T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}\phi^{\nu}\,\sqrt{\gamma}\, \dd^3 x\ .
\end{equation}
%
In the cylindrical coordinates $x^i=(r,\phi,z)$ adapted to the symmetry
the angular momentum density is  
%
\begin{equation}
j = %-
\rho h W^2 v_{\phi} \ ,
\label{eq:method:ang_mom}
\end{equation}
%
and the angular momentum flux is 
%
\begin{equation}
\alpha\sqrt{\gamma}T^r _{\nu}\phi^{\nu} =
\alpha\sqrt{\gamma}\rho h W^2 (v^{r}v_{\phi}) .
\end{equation}

We evaluate these quantities from the 3D snapshots of our simulations.




\subsection{Ejecta} \label{sec:bns_sims:method:ejecta}

To model and study the electromagnetic counterparts to mergers, the amount and properties 
of the material leaving the system are needed.
The matter expelled at high velocity may ultimately become unbound from the 
central gravitational potential. 
There are two indicators commonly adopted to mark the unbound matter.

\subsubsection{The Geodesic criterion}

Assuming that the spacetime is stationary, ($\partial_t$ is the Killing vector)% \red{confirm}, 
the four-velocity, $u_t$, (along the time-like killing vector), 
is a constant of motion for geodesics. 
Additionally, if the space is asymptotically flat, at infinity the $u_t = -W$, 
where $W$ is the fluid element Lorentz factor. 
Then, if a fluid element has $u_t < -1$, it may be considered unbound 
as it will retain the non-zero positive velocity at infinity. 
%
The fluid asymptotic velocity 
\begin{equation}
    \upsilon_{\infty} \simeq \sqrt{2E_{\infty}} = \sqrt{(1-u_t ^2)}.
\end{equation}
%
This criterion can be through of as considering the fluid to be made of isolated 
particles that follow the geodesics. Indeed, the effects of \acp{EOS}, 
fluids pressure gradient, internal energy and heating %(\eg, due to an $r$-process (\red{see section XXX})) 
are neglected which might lead to 
underestimation of the ejecta mass. 
%
The space time is also assumed to be static.
%
Strictly speaking, none of these assumptions is 
fulfilled in the \ac{BNS} post-merger environment. However, this criterion 
is widely used in the literature \citep[\eg][]{Radice:2018pdn,Vincent:2019kor}.



\subsubsection{The Bernoulli criterion}

From the relativistic Bernoulli equation \citep{Rezzolla:2013}, it follows
that for a stationary relativistic flow, the $hu_t$ is constant along the 
fluid worldliens. Here $h$ is the (relativistic) enthalpy, which is
defined up to a constant factor. 
%
If at the spatial infinity the enthalpy is set so $h\rightarrow-1$, 
%\red{in Vincent it is $h\leftarrow 1$}
the condition $hu_t < -1$ would mark the unbound matter 
(as in the assymptotically flat space-time the 
$u_t = -W$ for the flow particles following geodesics).
%
The associated asymptotic velocity is calculated as 
%
\begin{equation}
\upsilon_{\infty} \simeq \sqrt{2 (h (E_{\infty}+1)-1)}. 
\end{equation}
%
The criterion can be regarded as assuming all the internal energy of the fluid 
gets added to the fluid kinetic energy, as the fluid decompresses \red{(pressure drops?)}.
%
%The $r$-process nucleosynthesis that occurs in the outflow deposits the energy.
%\red{In Vincent it is assumed that the difference in binding energy between the 
%    particles in NSE at a given $\rho$, $T$ and $Y_e$, and their binding energy at
%    the same $Y_e$ but low $\rho$ and $T$ is added/substracted from the fluid's kinetic energy.
%    Out-of-NSE evolution and effects this neglected \citep[][see]{Foucart:2016vxd}
%    [BUT I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE CASE FOR OUR SIMULATIONS! MAYBE NOT!]}
%
This criterion has been reported to estimate the amount of unbound material more accurately
\citep{Foucart:2015gaa}. 
Moreover, it was reported that the Bernoulli criterion leads to up to twice 
the amount of ejecta detected in comparison with the geodesic criterion, 
if the estimation is done within a given volume \citep{Kastaun:2014fna}.



We adopt the geodesic criterion to study the "burst-like", short outflows,
such as dynamical ejecta, where the pressure gradient is not expected to make a significant contribution.
For the steady-state outflows, like \pmerg{} winds we adopt the Bernoulli criterion.
%
The term ejecta would refer to the material gravitationaly 
unbound according to either of the criteria.
%
All ejecta properties are evaluated at $R \simeq 294$ from the center of the 
simulation domain unless stated otherwise.

\section{Results}

}

In this chapter we review the findings of \citet{Nedora:2019jhl} and \citet{Nedora:2020pak}
and investigate the long-term \pmerg{} evolution of the binary neutron star. 

Such studies are of high astrophysical importance as the ejecta of matter that occur 
on various timescales \pmerg{} undergoes \rproc{} and produces observable EM emission. 
The discussion of the \rproc{} and EM transits themselves, we resort for the chapter \red{chap:coutnerparts}.


The novelty of the set of models discussed in this thesis with respect to the 
previous study by \citet{Radice:2018pdn} is that all models include the neutrino heating via 
M0 scheme in addition to the neutrino cooling (see Sec.\ref{sec:nr_methods:neut}), 
and for most models the effects of subgrid turbulence (see Set.\ref{sec:nr_methds:visc}) 
are included. Meanwhile, our models cover a significantly more narrow range in 
dimensionless tidal deformability, $\tilde{\Lambda}$, and mass ratio, motivated by the \GW{}.

In total we consider a sample of $37$ models of unique binaries with the 
chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c = 1.188\,\Msun$ that corresponds to the source of \GW{}.
%
The total gravitational mass covers the range $M\in[2.73, 2.88]\Msun$, while the 
mas ration $q=M_A/M_B\in[1,1.8]$. 
%
We show the masses and radii of computed models as markers in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:method:tov_mr} and summarize their main properties, 
and the dynamical ejecta properties in Tab.~\ref{tab:sim}.
%
Most simulations are performed with at least two resolutions, 
\texttt{LR} and \texttt{SR}. 
Additionally, $16$ binaries are simulated at high resolution, \texttt{HR}.
In total $76$ models are computed and analyzed.
%
Several binaries that resulted in a formation of a \ac{MNS} that does not collapse 
to a \ac{BH} are evolved up to $100$~ms \pmerg.
%
Most simulations include the effects of subgrid turbulence. 
Those that are not are marked with ``*'' next to the equation of state name.
%
The naming convention for simulations is the following: 
the equation of state name, the mass ratio, and the resolution, \eg, 
the ``BLh* $q=1.00$ (\texttt{SR})" would refer to the simulation of the equal mass
binary performed with BLh \ac{EOS}, without subgrid turbulence and at standard resolution.

%\subsection{Overview}

A newly born \ac{MNS} is not axisymmetric. In addition to driving the angular 
momentum transport, it is a strong emitter of \acp{GW} at kiloHertz frequencies.
In ${\sim}10-20$~ms \pmerg{} \acp{GW} remove about two times the 
amount of energy that was lost during the inspiral and merger \citep{Bernuzzi:2015opx}.
%
After that, the contribution of \acp{GW} to the system evolution, specifically to the 
angular momentum loss, drops \citep{Radice:2018xqa}. The long-term evolution, $\O(100)$~ms,
of the remnant is driven primarily by the viscous processes and weak interactions.
%
After the emission of \acp{GW} subsides. However the \acp{MNS} remnant still has an excess 
in angular momentum and gravitational mass, with respect to the cold, 
rigidly rotating equilibrium with the same baryoinc mass \citep{Radice:2018xqa}.
%
Subsequent evolution of the \ac{MNS} proceeds towards the axisymmetric configuration 
close to the mass-shedding limit. 
Depending on the lifetime of the \ac{MNS} remnant we distinguish \textit{long-lived}
and \textit{short-lived} remnants.
However, would a \ac{MNS} reach this state or collapse to a \ac{BH} depends on the 
details of \pmerg{} state and on the temperature and composition effects.

        radiation and becomes comparable to the $m=1$ mode on a timescale of

        a longer period. The $m=2$ mode is instead dominant to collapse in

        (Adopted from \cite{Nedora:2020pak})
    }
    \label{fig:dens_modes}
\end{figure*}

We begin with analyzing the \pmerg{} dynamics of the \ac{MNS} remnant. The standard 
probe is employed here, namely the complex decomposition of the hydrodynamical models
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:modes}). 
%
The result of the mode analysis is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dens_modes} for two 
representative simulations, the model with LS220 \ac{EOS}, $q=1.00$ and a 
short-lived remnant, and model with DD2 \ac{EOS}, $q=1.00$ and a long-lived 
\ac{MNS} remnant.
%
The newly born \ac{MNS} remnants are not axisymmetric, displaying characteristic 
spiral arms, extending outwards from the shock interface of the collided cores 
\citep{Shibata:1999wm,Shibata:2006nm,Bernuzzi:2013rza,Kastaun:2014fna,East:2015vix,Paschalidis:2015mla,Radice:2016gym,Lehner:2016wjg}.
%
This arms can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ang_mom_flux}. 
%
The $m=2$, instability, characterized by a bar-shaped fluid, is the dominant one early 
in \pmerg{}, while the $m=1$ instability, so-called one-armed spiral instability, 
starts to dominate in the late evolution 
\citep{East:2015vix,Paschalidis:2015mla,Radice:2016gym,Lehner:2016wjg,Bernuzzi:2013rza,Kastaun:2014fna}.
\red{One sentence 'why', physically}
%
Indeed, the $m=2$ mode remains the dominant one until $\sim15-20$~ms \pmerg{}. 
After that, the model with LS220 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$ forms a \ac{BH}. 
In the model with DD2 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$ model, however, the $m=1$ mode 
becomes comparable with $m=1$ throughout the remainder of the evolution, while 
the $m=2$ mode efficiently dissipates through \ac{GW} emission 
\citep{Bernuzzi:2015opx,Radice:2016gym}.
\red{Why $m=1$ does not dissipates via \acp{GW}}
%
We find that the magnitude of the $m=1$ mode increases with the binary \mr{}.
For instance the largest $C_{m=1}$ are found in models BLh and LS220 \acp{EOS}
and \mr{}s $q=1.43$ and $q=1.22$ respectively. 
% Stronger $m=1$ leads to more large \ac{SWW} mass flux.  %------------------------------------------- ABOUT WIND
The dependency of the $C_{m=2}$ on \mr{} however is not clear. 
Our result is in agreement with what reported by \citet{Lehner:2016wjg}.

Formation of the spiral arms is a generic hydrodynamic effect, that was identified 
in the \ac{NR} simulations with polytropic \ac{EOS} \citep{Bernuzzi:2013rza,Radice:2016gym}.
However, the evolution of these arms and quantitative behaviour of hydrodynamic
modes depends on the physics input. The turbulent viscosity, for instance, 
leads to the faster suppressing of the $m=2$. By contrast, the $m=1$ modes are not
significantly affected by viscosity, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dens_modes}.
%
In case of the model with the short-lived remnant, \ie, with LS22 \ac{EOS} and
$q=1.00$, the effect of the subgrid turbulence is not apparent because 
the dynamical evolution is interrupted by the collapse.
%
We compute the angular momentum of the \ac{MNS} remnant following the method,
discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:ang_mom}, where the remnant is distinguished 
from the disk on the basis of the rest mass density $\rho=10^{13}$~\gcm{} 
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:disk}).
%
We find that for a long-lived \ac{MNS} remnants on a timescale of $\sim20$~ms, 
about half of the total angular momentum of the \ac{MNS} remnant is transferred 
into the disk. 
%% [ from shibata review ]
This is a consequence of the fact that the remnant \ac{MNS} is strongly deformed 
after merger and gravitational torque on the surrounding matter, 
that allows for a rapid angular momentum transport.
%% ---
%After, the remnant and the disk settle on quasi-stationary evolution path.
%(see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_dynsmics_overview}).

Following the disk and remnant mass evolution we observe, that the spiral 
density modes inject ${\sim}0.1-0.4\,\Msun$ of baryon mass into the disk during the 
first ${\sim}20$ms. 
The mass injection appears to be stronger in models with stiffer \acp{EOS}. 
With respect to the \mr{}, the higher $q$ binaries form a larger disks 
(see model with BLh \ac{EOS}, $q=1.82$ and model with LS220 \ac{EOS} $q=1.43$ 
on the Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_mass_evo} that do not have turbulent viscosity).

\begin{figure}[t]

    \label{fig:disk_ang_mom_flux_map_blh_q1}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_ang_mom_flux_map_blh_q1} we show how the angular momentum is 
being transported from the \ac{MNS} remnant into the disk in two model with long-lived 
\ac{MNS} remnants and included turbulent viscosity.
%
These are the models with DD2 \ac{EOS} $q=1.00$ and BLh \ac{EOS} $q=1.00$.
%
The angular momentum is transported via spiral waves that correspond to the 
$m=1$ and $m=2$ hydrodynamic models, discussed above.
We observer, that in the model with more stiff DD2 \ac{EOS},
the fist wave is considerably stronger. Notably, the model with DD2 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$  
also has a more massive disk.
%
Further, the evolution of the disk-remnant interactions after $\sim20$~ms \pmerg{} 
is different for two models. While the model with DD2 \ac{EOS} stops 
shedding mass into its disk and starts slowly accreting, the model with BLh \ac{EOS} 
continues to shed mass into the disk (see Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_mass_evo} and discussion in
Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_dynsmics_overview})
%
The latter is caused by the strong angular momentum flux \red{actually the plot shows, that it is not}, 
emanating from the \ac{MNS} remnant and by the larger temperatures, 
that reached in the model with the BLh \ac{EOS}.
%
Larger temperatures lead to lower rotational frequency at which the mass 
shedding occurs \citep{Kaplan:2013wra}. 

The subgrid turbulence enhances the angular momentum transport. However more simulations of long-lived 
\ac{MNS} remnants are needed to asses the effects of the 
subgrid turbulence and \mr{} systematically. 


\subsection{Remnant-disk evolution}

\subsubsection*{High mass ratio binaries}

%% --- On THE PROMPT collapse
We find that in models with high \mr{}, \eg, $q\gtrsim1.67$, the companion star (less 
massive one) undergoes tidal disruption before merger as the tidal forces overcome the star's 
binding energy. The matter forms an disk around the primary.
The accretion raises the mass of the remaining \ac{NS} beyond the maximum supported limit by the 
\ac{EOS}, which leads to collapse. 
These are so-called, prompt collapse cases \citep{Radice:2020ddv,Bernuzzi:2020tgt,Bernuzzi:2020txg}.
They are characterized by the monotonic increase of the central density during the merger.
%The newly formed \ac{BH} is surrounded by the accretion disk that was 
%left from the tidally disrupted companion.
%
At formation, the disk has a large baryon mass, ${\sim}0.15\,\Msun$, in comparison with 
disks fromed in prompt collapse of equal mass binaries, \citep[\eg][]{Radice:2018pdn}.  
The disk is also neutron-rich $Y_e\sim 0.1$.
%
We show the evolution of the disk mass of several representative models in Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_mass_evo}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{disk/total_disk_mass_evo.pdf}
    \caption{Time evolution of the total disk mass for a few selected
        short-lived and long-lived cases. The former show a rapid 
        accretion right after disk formation. The plots show
        distinct difference in dynamical evolution after disk formation: accretion onto
        the newly formed BH (short-lived remnants) or accretion onto the NS
        remnant (DD2 $q=1$) with possible continuous mass shedding from the remnant
        into the disk (BLh* $q=1$). Adopted from \citet{Nedora:2020pak}
    } 
    \label{fig:disk_mass_evo}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Binaries with $q\lesssim1.4$}

Binaries with small mass ratio, ($q\lesssim1.4$) produce a \ac{MNS} remnant
that either survives on a dynamical timescale, set by the \ac{NS} rotation, before
collapsing to a \ac{BH}, or a \ac{MNS} that survives till the end of the simulations.
%We refer to the former ones as \textit{short-lived} and the latter ones as %% ---------- Defind Above
%\textit{long-lived} remnants.
%
Most binaries producing short-lived remnants have relatively soft \acp{EOS}
and small \mr{}s, \eg, LS220 \ac{EOS} $q=1,1.1,1.2$, SFHo \ac{EOS} $q=1,1.1,1.4$ 
and SLy \ac{EOS} $q=1,1.1,1.4$. They collapse within $\sim20$~ms \pmerg. 
The exact time of the collapse however depends on the simulation resolution 
and on the inclusion of subgrid turbulence as was previosly noted by \citet{Radice:2017zta}.


\subsubsection*{Disk of short-lived remnants}

During the merger, shocks, generated at the collisional interface of the \ac{NS} cores,
as well as, tidal torques exerted by the non axisymmetric remnant, result in a formation
of the disk. Matter, energy and angular momentum are injected into the disk as the spiral 
density waves propagate outwards from the mass-shedding \ac{MNS} remnant 
\citep{Bernuzzi:2015opx,Radice:2018xqa}.
%\red{HERE the letter stuff could be added, actually}
%
% --- Letter stuff
These spiral arms extend from the \ac{MNS} into the disk and transport angular 
momentum outwards as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ang_mom_flux}. %Such global density waves are --- written above 
%a generic and efficient mechanism to redistribute energy and eventually deplete  
%accretion disks \citep{Goodman:2001a,Rafikov:2016a,Arzamasskiy:2018a}. 
%% Crucially, we find that both the $m=1$ and $m=2$ modes generate a \wind{} from the
%% disk's outer layers that is distinct from the dynamical ejecta, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ej_properties}.
%
Within these waves the fluid temperature is the highest, which however, decreases rapidly, as 
disk expands and cools via neutrino emission.
High temperatures lead to the electron-positron pair creation, 
%% [added from Shibata Review paper]
facilitating the positron capture by free neutrons $n+e^+p\rightarrow\bar{\nu}_e$ in the disk.
%
The average particle energies are large, close to the mass difference between neutron 
and proton. 
The entropy per baryon varies between $3$ and $\lesssim 10\,$$k_{B}$/baryon \citep{Perego:2019adq}.
In combination with the high $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ luminosities,
the large number of available positrons leads to an increase 
in the fluid electron fraction, $Y_e$, in relation to the initially neutron-rich material
\citep{Qian:1996xt}.
%
Additionally, a \ac{MNS} itself is a strong neutrino emitter. The neutrino irradiation of the 
surrounding area alters its composition, as neutrons and protons absorb the neutrinos,
$n+\nu_e\rightarrow p + e^{-}$ and $p + \bar{\nu}_e\rightarrow n + e^+$.
This drives the neutron and proton fraction towards equilibrium, and raises the $Y_e$.
%\red{paper says: 
%    The electron fraction is reset by an initial excess of electron antineutrino emission
%    and electron neutrino absorption,}
%% ---
If \ac{MNS} remnant collapses to a \ac{BH}, the main source of neutrinos shuts down,  
the inner part of the disk accrets rapidly, and the disk itself settles onto quasi-steady state, 
with axisymmetric, approximately Keplerian profile (see Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_mass_evo}).
%
The inner part of the final disk, at densities $\rho\sim10^{13}$~\gcm, 
is relatively hot, $T\sim10\,$ MeV, but neutron-rich $Y_e\sim0.1$, as it was shielded 
from the neutrino irradiation. The matter gets progressively colder and proton-rich 
outwards with $Y_e$ reaching $0.4$ at the edges.
%
The disk mass at formation appears to depend on the \ac{NS} \ac{EOS}. Binaries with 
stiffer \ac{EOS} (larger \ac{NS} radii) produce more massive disk.
Additionally, the disk mass show a dependency on mass ratio. For instance, the most massive 
disks are formed in LS220 $q=1.43$ and  BLh $q=1.82$ models, where the latter experiences prompt collapse.
%
We examine these relations more closely in the chapter~\ref{ch:stat}, Sec.~\ref{sec:stat:remdisk}.
%% -- 
The disk accretion onto a \ac{BH} removes up to $50\%$ of its mass on a timescale of tens of milliseconds.


\subsubsection*{Disk of long-lived remnants}


If the \ac{MNS} is long-lived, the disk has time to complete its formation,
and thus it is more massive and extended \citep{Perego:2019adq}. 
%As before, the disk is defined as matter, with $\rho\lesssim10^{13}$~\gcm. 
The final mass is higher for models with larger \mr{} and stiffer \ac{EOS}.
For instance, for the model with $q=1.00$ and BLh \ac{EOS}, 
the disk mass reaches ${\lesssim}0.15\,\Msun$, while the model with $q=1.00$ 
and DD2 \ac{EOS} it exceeds ${\sim}0.2\,\Msun$. For the models with BLh \acp{EOS}, 
the disk mass increases between $q=1.00$ and $q\sim1.4-1.5$ by a $100\%$.
%
The long-term evolution of the disk is driven by its interaction with the \ac{MNS} 
remnant and cooling. And while in the case of a \ac{BH} remnant, the only possible 
interaction is the disk accretion onto a \ac{BH}, in the case of a \ac{MNS} remnant 
the picture is more complex.
%
The disk neutrino cooling and gravitational pull from the remnant facilitates the 
accretion. Simultaneously, spiral density waves inject %generated at shocks,
energy and angular momentum into the disk as well as centrifugally supported 
material (the \ac{MNS} undergoes mass-shedding). This heats up the disk and 
facilitates its expansion. 
%
In the figure Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_mass_evo} the quasi-steady state disk accretion
is seen for the model with DD2 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$. Meanwhile, the mass-shedding 
by the remnant adds more material into the disk than is being accretted as is the 
case for the model with BLh \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$. 
%
The analysis suggests, that this behaviour is due to two main factors: the 
very high average temperatures of the remnant and the disk reached in this model, that  
are a consequence of the thermal effects included into the BLh \ac{EOS} 
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:nr_methods:eos}), and the softness of the \ac{EOS}, which leads 
to the strong oscillations of the remnant after merger (see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:dens_modes}).
%
The inclusion of the subgrid turbulence smears the mass distribution of disk 
properties. The distributions of electron fraction, entropy per baryon and 
temperature appears broader. A more detailed quantitative analysis would require more 
simulations performed at several resolutions to disentangle the effects 
caused by the subgrid turbulence and by the finite grid \citep{Bernuzzi:2020txg,Radice:2020ids}.

\subsubsection*{Evolution of disk properties}

%% Ye evolution
The evolution of the mass-weighted electron fraction for the model with
BLh \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$, which is evolved till $\sim 90$~ms after merger, 
is shown on the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:total_disk_time_corr_Ye_Blh_q1}.
%
During the formation, shocks and spiral waves raise the disk electron fraction to
$Y_e\sim0.25$. As the disk evolves, the bulk of its mass, shielded from neutrinos, 
(Fig.~\ref{fig:slice:heating_hu}, density contours) returns to neutron-rich 
condition with $Y_e\lesssim0.1$. The outer part of the disk, however, is 
subjected to the strong neutrino irradiation and reaches $Y_e\sim0.4$ of a 
timescale of ${\sim}40$~ms.
%% Note that neutrinos in merger remnants decouple at $\rho\sim10^{11}$~$\gccm$ \citep{Endrizzi:2019trv}. 
Notably, the apparent gap in the $Y_e$ distribution in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:total_disk_time_corr_Ye_Blh_q1} at $\langle Y_e \rangle \simeq 0.15$ 
might not be of physical origin, but an artifact from the neutrino M0 scheme, 
that assumes neutrinos propagate along the radial directions
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:nr_methods:neut}, that is not well suited for capturing the 
neutrino emission and re-bsorption from the disk midplane.
%
In case of a short-lived model with LS220 \ac{EOS} and $q=1.43$ 
(right panel of the Fig.~\ref{fig:total_disk_time_corr_Ye_Blh_q1})
the average electron fraction is lower as the strong neutrino emitter,
\ac{MNS}, collapses shortly after merger. 
%
%Additionally, the outskirts of the more compact disk remain 
%at low electron fraction as the neutrino emitted by the disk itself 
%are the only source of neutrinos.

In this section we discuss the final structure and properties of the disk, 
focusing on the models with long-lived \ac{MNS} remnants.
The properties are extracted at typical time $\sim60{-}100$~ms after merger.
%
We find that the generally the disk is optically thick.
The disk' \ac{RMS} half-openning angle appears to be independent of the 
\ac{EOS} and \mr{} and is $\langle\theta\rangle_{\text{rms}}\sim60^{\circ}$. 
The radial extend of the disk, however increases with the \ac{EOS} softness and 
binary \mr{}.
%
Similarly, the final disk mass is larger for the unequal mass binaries, 
ranging overall between ${\sim}0.1M_{\odot}$ and ${\sim}0.4M_{\odot}$
(see Tab.~\ref{tab:sim}).
%
Notably, for models with long-lived remnants the disk mass is larger,
that for the those with short-lived remnants. This can be attributed to the 
rapid accretion onto a \ac{BH} that removes $\sim50\%$ of the disk mass.
%
We investigate the overall statistical properties of the disk mass for all our models
and compare them to those available in the literature in Sec.~\ref{sec:stat:remdisk}
%
%\gray{
%    The mean value of the disk mass in out models is 
%    $\overline{M}_{\text{disk}}=(0.161 \pm 0.083)M_{\odot}$,
%    where the standard deviation is also reported.
%    %% ---
%    Similarly to the dynamical ejecta we fit the disk masses with the 
%    second order polynomial in $(q,\tilde{\Lambda})$.
%    The coefficients of Eq.~\eqref{eq:fit:poly22}
%    for this fit are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:fitpoly22coefs}.
%    A more detailed study with various fitting formulas and extended
%    datasets from the literature is reported in a companion paper.
%}

Next, we consider the composition of the disk at the end of the simulation.
%
The mass-averaged temperature, electron fraction and entropy per baryon
are for several models are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:final_disk_struct_hist_long}.
%
We observe that the mass-weighted distribution of the entropy and electron 
fraction show a bimodal structure, which is more pronounced for the 
equal mass binaries. 
Regarding entropy, two peaks are present in the distribution:
a peak low entropy $s\sim5-10k_B/$baryon, that depends weakly of the 
\ac{EOS} and \mr{} and corresponds to the bulk, mildly shocked, material. 
The second peak is found at higher entropy, $s\sim15-22k_B/$baryon.
It corresponds to the strongly shocked material and is more prominent 
in models with softer \ac{EOS}. Notably, in the models with higher \mr{}, 
the second peak is located at lower $s$. The mass-weighted distribution 
of the electron fraction displays a similar double-peak structure.
The low $Y_e$ peak that corresponds to the neutrino-shielded part of the 
disk is located around the $Y_e\sim0.1$. The high $Y_e$ peak is located at 
$Y_e\sim0.3-0.4$ and corresponds to the outer parts of the disk, subjected 
to a strong neutrino irradiation.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots_xy_ye_entr} we show the electron fraction 
and entropy per baryon on the $xy$ and $xz$ slices of the equal 
mass model with BLh \ac{EOS}. The plot shows, that the two peaks in the 
mass-weighted distribution of electron fraction and entropy correspond to 
different regions within the disk.
%
Overall, the most of the disk matter has temperature of $T\sim 1-10\,$MeV, with the 
innermost parts being hotter then the outer outermost. 
However, the disk temperature distribution appears to be largely 
independent of the \ac{EOS} and \mr{}

\subsection{Mass ejection on a longed timescale}

As the disk expands and cools, the recombination of nucleons into alpha particles 
starts to take place. The energy, released in recombination, might be sufficient 
for the outermost layers to become unbound, generating an outflow and contributing 
to the disk depletion \citep{Beloborodov:2008nx,Lee:2009uc,Fernandez:2013tya}.
%
This process however is expected to take place on timescales, longer than
those that are simulated here. On the $\sim100$~ms timescale, however, the outflows 
are driven by the neutrino heating, above the remnant, the so-called neutrino-driven 
wind (\nwind; \citep{Dessart:2008zd,Perego:2014fma,Just:2014fka}), and by the dynamical 
interactions between the \ac{MNS} remnant and the disk, the \swind{} \citep{Nedora:2019jhl}.
%
We discuss the properties of the \nwind{} found in our simulations
in Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:nwind} and the properties of the 
\swind{} in Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:sww}.
%The \swind{} can have a mass up to
%a few $10^{-2}\,\Mo$ and velocities ${\sim}0.2$~c. The ejecta
%have electron fraction typically larger than ${\sim} 0.25$ since they are 
%partially reprocessed by hydrodynamic shocks in the expanding arms. 
%The \nwind{} is driven by neutrino heating above the remnant. It generates outflows
%with smaller masses ${\sim} 10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ and larger $Y_e$
%than the \swind{}. 
%Differently from \swind{} the mass flux of the \nwind{} in our simulations subsides 
%before the end of out simulations, due to rapid baryon loading of the 
%polar region.
%The \swind{} will be discussed in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:spiralw}.
The effects of these outflows on the dynamical evolution of the remnant 
lies in the amount of mass and angular momentum they can remove from the system.
%
Specifically, the \nwind{} have a typical mass of ${\sim} 10^{-4}\Msun$, 
while the \swind{} could remove $10^{-2}\,\Msun$ on a timescale of a $\sim100$~ms.

Quantitative understanding of the \pmerg{} dynamics on the timescales 
longer than those presented here requires ab-initio \ac{NR} simulations in 
$(3+1)D$ with compete physics.
%
Here we asses the possible long term evolution via an indirect method.
We consider the model with BLh \ac{EOS} and $q=1.00$, one of the longest runs 
performed. 
%
After the merger, the \ac{MNS} remnant is born with an excess in baryon mass
with respect to the beta-equilibrium \ac{NS} configurations
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:total_j_mb_rns_blh} we show the evolution of the 
total baryon mass, $M_b$, and total angular momentum, $J$, of the remnant
(for the definition of the latter see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:ang_mom}).
%
At early \pmerg{}, when no substantial outflow happened, the 
evolution is governed by the emission of \acp{GW} and the remnant loses 
angular momentum retaining constant baryonic mass, $M_b=\text{const}$ part.
%
We evaluate the amount of angular momentum lost to \acp{GW} following the 
\citet{Damour:2011fu,Bernuzzi:2012ci,Bernuzzi:2015rla}\footnote{
    The radiated angular momentum is computed from the 
    multipole moments $N_{lm}$ for the \ac{NR} complex "news function" at infinity. 
    The $J_{z;\text{rad}}(t)$ is computed as \citep{Damour:2011fu} 
    \begin{equation*}
    \Delta J_{z\text{rad}}(t) \frac{1}{16}\sum_{l,m}^{l_{max}}\int_{t_0}^{t} dt' m \mathcal{L}[h_{lm}(t')(N_{lm}(t'))^*],
    \end{equation*}
    where $h_{lm}$ is the multipolar metric waveform, 
    $N_{lm}(t) = dh_{lm}(t) / dt$, the news function, and $l_{max}=8$.
    The $J$ loss is metric dependent ($h$).
    The $h$ (strain???) is computed from $\Psi_4(t) = dN/dt = d^2h/dt^2$ by a 
    frequency-domain integration procedure with a low-frequency cut 
    $\omega_0 = 0.032/(m_1+m_2)$.
    The routines used for the calculation are taken from the scientific library
    \texttt{scidata}, available at \url{https://bitbucket.org/dradice/scidata}.
}.
%
Substructed from the initial data \ac{ADM} angular momentum \red{(see \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5429.pdf})} 
we obtain the value that is left to the system after the \ac{GW} phase 
(the yellow marker in Fig.~\ref{fig:total_j_mb_rns_blh}).
%
Notably, after the \ac{GW} phase, the remnant still has an excess in angular momentum
in comparison with the rigidly rotating \ac{NS} configurations with the same baryon mass 
(gray triangular region in Fig.~\ref{fig:total_j_mb_rns_blh}).
%
We observe the same situation across all our models.% \citep{Zappa:2017xba,Radice:2018xqa}.


The baryon mass of the remnant also exceeds maximum mass that a rigidly rotating 
equilibria could have. Such remnant is generally referred to as a \ac{HMNS} following the 
nomenclature introduced for zero-temperature \ac{EOS} equilibria \acp{NS} \citep{Baumgarte:1999cq}.
Such a remnant is expected to collapse to a \ac{BH} shortly after formation. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:total_j_mb_rns_blh} we show that a remnant can avoid the collapse by 
efficiently removing angular momentum and mass, and can reach the rigidly rotating equilibria phase,
avoiding the collapse.
%
We compute the angular momentum and baryon mas evolution of the remnant, 
through volume integrals, assuming axisymmetric and evaluating the former using 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:method:ang_mom}, and the latter using the Eq.~\eqref{eq:method:mdisk},
relaxing the rest-mass density criterion. 
The evolution of these two quantities is depicted with the black solid line if 
Fig.~\eqref{fig:total_j_mb_rns_blh}~\footnote{
    Note that the angular momentum estimated
    from the \ac{GW} and from the integral of Eq.~\eqref{eq:method:ang_mom} assuming
    axisymmetry are compatible within the errors made in the latter estimate.
}.
%
We observed that after the \ac{GW} phase, the remnant continues to evolve, loosing the 
angular momentum together with the baryon mass. This is achieved through massive outflow,
the \swind{}. 
%
The extrapolation of the final trend of the mass and angular momentum loss shows that 
if $\approx0.05\,\Msun$ ($\approx40$\% of the final disk at the end of simulation) is 
ejected, the \ac{MNS} remnant would approach the rigidly rotating equilibria region 
at the mass-shedding limit. Extrapolation indicates, that if the ejecta mass flux does 
not change, this would occur on a timescale of $\sim 300$~ms \pmerg{}.
%
Similar results are obtained with the conservative upper bound estimate on the 
evolution of the long-lived remnant (Eq.~$2$ in \citet{Radice:2018xqa}) (green dashed line in 
the figure). 
%%%% From Radice18 paper on ViscousEjecta
%A more conservative estimate can be obtained assuming
%that the material becomes unbound due to the recombination
%of nucleons into nuclei and the subsequent liberation of
%nuclear binding energy, a scenario discussed in detail in 
%Beloborodov (2008), Lee et al. (2009), and Fernandez \& Metzger
%(2013), among others. This has been shown to occur
%once the material has reached a cylindrical radius $r*$ at
%which the nuclear recombination energy equals the gravitational
%binding energy (Lee et al. 2009; Fernandez & Metzger 2013), that is
%
%\begin{equation}
%    \frac{G M m_b}{r*} \approxeq 8.8\, \text{MeV}
%\end{equation}
%
%In the previous equation $M$ is the central object mass and
%$m_b$ is the average baryon mass. Accordingly, a ring of material
%initially orbiting at radius $r < r*$ and becoming unbound
%would carry away, in addition to its specific angular
%momentum $j(r)$, also the angular momentum needed to expand
%to $r*$. Assuming a Keplerian disk, this implies that
%the angular momentum carried away by the ring initially at
%$r$ is
%
%\begin{equation}
%    j*(r) = j(r) \Big( \frac{r*}{r} \Big)^{1/2}
%\end{equation}
%
%We take $r* = 300 G/c^2M$ as fiducial value, corresponding
%to $M \approxeq 2.5M_{\odot}$. We repeat the tally of angular momentum
%and mass that can be removed from the remnant
%taking into account the previous equation. The results are
%represented by the blue line in Fig. 3 laying inside the allowed
%region for the viscous evolution. This yields an ejecta
%mass of ${\sim}0.05\Msun$for the DD2 (1.35 + 1.35)$\Msun$ binary.
%Our estimate is in good agreement with the results of Fujibayashi
%et al. (2018), who considered the post-merger evolution
%of the same binary with 2D axisymmetric viscous
%GRHD simulations. They estimated the viscous ejecta mass
%to be ${\sim}0.05\Msun$. Note, however, that the mass ejection was
%still ongoing at the end of the simulations presented by Fujibayashi
%et al. (2018), so the total ejecta mass might be
%larger than what they estimated.
In that work, the recombination of nucleons into nuclei and the subsequent 
liberation of nuclear binding energy was employed as a driving force 
of the massive outflows. A matter becomes unbound gravitationally 
once it reaches a cylindrical radius $r*$ at which the nuclear recombination energy 
equals the gravitational binding energy
\citep[\eg][]{Fernandez:2013tya}

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{G M m_b}{r*} \approxeq 8.8\, \text{MeV}
\end{equation*}

where $M$ the central object mass and $m_b$ is the average baryon mass.
Thus, a ring of material located at $r < r*$, once it becomes unbound
would remove, in addition to its specific angular
momentum $j(r)$, also the angular momentum required to reach
to $r*$. If the disk is Keplerian, the 
 angular momentum carried away by the ring initially at
$r$ is 

\begin{equation*}
    j*(r) = j(r) \Big( \frac{r*}{r} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}
%
where $r* = 300 G/c^2M$assumed as fiducial value, corresponding
to $M \approxeq 2.5M_{\odot}$ \citep{Radice:2018xqa}.

%\red{WHAT the fuck is Keplerian limit, mass-shedding limit and rigidly rotating equilibria}
Additionally, while this simulation included the effects of turbulent viscosity on the
angular momentum transport, the ejecta could be further enhanced by the magnetic stresses 
\citep{Metzger:2006mw,Bucciantini:2011kx,Siegel:2017nub,Fernandez:2018kax,Ciolfi:2020hgg}.
%
%
Other simulations also produce a \ac{MNS} remnants with a similar evolutionary paths. 
Models with DD2 \ac{EOS} however, are born with an excess in angular momentum but not in 
baryon mass. They also evolve toward the rigidly rotating equilibria but slower.
Models with $q>1.00$ produce remnants that generally have larger excess in angular momentum 
and mass have how to shed a larger amount of mas to reach equilibrium configuration.
(\red{However we also show that these models tend to have stronger \swind{}, see sec.SPIRAL.WIND})
Overall, we estimate that for models with $q=1.00$ need to shed ${\sim}0.05\Msun$ while 
models with $q\eqsim 1.4$ need to remove $0.2\Msun$ to reach equilibrium configuration.

\section{Mass ejection in \ac{BNS} merger simulations}

%% \section{Results -- Mass Ejection}


Tidal interactions and shocks exerted on the \acp{NS} at merger 
trigger the ejection of material on the dynamical timescale. This is the \ac{DE} 
\citep[\eg][]{Hotokezaka:2013b,Bauswein:2013yna,Radice:2016dwd,Radice:2018pdn}. 
\red{a bit more}



\subsection{Dynamical Ejecta} \label{sec:bns_sims:dyn}

%\red{EJECTA to be moved to its own section}
%The models that undergo the prompt collapse also eject matter on a dynamical timescale. 
%The ejecta originates from tidal disruption of the compantion. It is neutron rich, 
%confined largely to the orbital plane and exhibits a crescent-like azimuthal structure \citep{Bernuzzi:2020txg}.


%% The mechanism behind the dynamical ejecta [radice:2018pnd]
%Tidal interactions and shocks exerted on the \acp{NS} at merger trigger the ejection of material
%on the dynamical timescale. This is the \ac{DE} \citep[\eg][]{Hotokezaka:2013b,Bauswein:2013yna,Radice:2016dwd,Radice:2018pdn}. 
%
%\red{More on the genral mechanism tidal vs shocked}
%The \ac{DE} is evaluated with the geodesic criterion introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:method:analysis:ejecta}.
%
%Describe shock vs tidal components 



When \acp{NS} collide and merger, matter is ejected through a number of 
different physical processes, gaining enough energy to become graviationally 
unbound (according to the criteria discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:ejecta}). 
%\alpedit{The matter ejected on dynamical timescale of the system (${\sim}10$~ms) 
%is called the dynamical ejecta.}{
In particular, the matter ejected within a few dynamical timescales (\ie, ${\sim}10$~ms) 
after merger by tidal torques and hydrodynamics shocks driven by core bounces 
is called \ac{DE} \citep[\eg][]{Hotokezaka:2013b,Bauswein:2013yna,Radice:2016dwd,Radice:2018pdn}. 
%
% From AFTERGLOW paper
%
Several mechanisms contribute to the ejection, and depending on the 
binary parameters, their relative contribution differs.
%
For instance, shortly before and during the merger, the outer parts 
of the \acp{NS}, opposite to the collisional interface, are stripped 
away by the tidal torque and centrifugal forces. This is the tidal 
component of the \ac{DE}. It is more massive in binaries with 
larger \mr{} and is maximum in those that experience tidal disruption 
\citep[\eg][]{Radice:2018pdn,Bernuzzi:2020txg}.
%
Such ejecta is neutron rich, confined largely to the orbital plane and exhibits 
a crescent-like azimuthal structure \citep{Bernuzzi:2020txg}.
%
Overall, the tidal ejecta component is mostly equatorial and its 
velocity is related to the \acp{NS}' velocity at merger and 
and the system's escape velocity, and is $\sim0.2$~c.
%
When \acp{NS}' cores collide and bounce, shocks propagate outwards inducing 
matter ejection. Additionally, a small amount of material at the 
\acp{NS}' collisional interface is shock-heated and launched into the polar 
direction. This comprises the shocked component of the \ac{DE}.
%
It is more massive and faster if \acp{NS}' radii are smaller and they collide 
at higher velocities \citep[\eg][]{Radice:2018pdn}. 
%
Overall the dynamical ejecta has a broad distribution in terms of composition, 
velocity and mass, dependent on the parameters of the binary and \ac{NS} \ac{EOS}.
%% === ON THE FAST DYNAMICAL EJECTA IN PARTICULAR ===========


\subsubsection{Overall properties of the \ac{DE}}

%The novelty of the set of models discussed in this thesis with respect to the 
%previous study by \citet{Radice:2018pdn} is that all models include the neutrino heating via 
%M0 scheme in addition to the neutrino cooling (see Sec.\ref{sec:nr_methods:neut}), 
%and for most models the effects of subgrid turbulence (see Set.\ref{sec:nr_methds:visc}) 
%are included. Meanwhile, our models cover a significantly more narrow range in 
%dimensionless tidal deformability, $\tilde{\Lambda}$, and mass ratio, motivated by the \GW{}.
%<<<< MOVED TO INTRO >>>>

We can qualitatively asses the effects of neutrino heating by comparing the overall 
properties of our models with those of \citet{Radice:2018pdn}, where the same 
simulation setup and code were used but only neutrino leakage scheme was employed.
%
We perform this comparison and the comprehansive statitical analysis of the 
ejecta properties in the chapter \ref{ch:stat}.
%
%Specifically, we observer, that neutrino absorption leads to not only an 
%increase in average electron fraction but also to larger total ejected mass and velocity. 
%The latter two would be crucial for the non-thermal, 
%kilonova afterglow (see Sec.\red{sec:KilonovaAfterglow}).
%%
%The mass averaged over the simulations from Tab.~\ref{tab:sim} is 
%$\overline{\amd} = (3.442 \pm 2.495)\times 10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}$ (where
%hereafter we report also the standard deviation), while the same
%quantity calculated for data of \cite{Radice:2018pdn} 
%is $\overline{\md} = (1.352\pm 1.250)\times 10^{-3}\,\Msun$.
%The mass-averaged terminal velocity of the dynamical ejecta 
%ranges between $0.1$c and $0.3$c, and in a good agreement with 
%\cite{Radice:2018pdn}.
%The mass-averaged velocity, averaged over all the simulations, is 
%$\overline{\avd} = (0.172\pm0.038)\,{\text{c}}$.
%
%We find that in our set of models, there is a correlation of $\avd$ with the tidal parameter 
%$\tilde{\Lambda}$: the higher the $\tilde{\Lambda}$ the lower the $\avd$.
%This can be understood from the general mechanism of the \ac{DE},
%that tells in mergers of binaries with $q=1.00$, the shocked component of the ejecta 
%is the dominant. The strength of shocks increases as the \acp{NS} become more compact 
%(with decreasing $\tilde{\Lambda}$) and hence collide at higher velocities~\footnote{Note that in the definition of prompt collapse we adopted, there is no shocked ejecta.}.
%%% ---
%For binaries with high mass ration, however, the tidal component of the \ac{DE} is dominant. 
%The velocity of the latter also is smaller for larger $\tilde{\Lambda}$, as stars collide 
%at slower velocities due to their larger radii. 
%%% ---
%The mass-averaged electron fraction, $\ayd$, of our models lies the range $(0.1, 0.3)$
%with an averaged value among all models $\overline{\ayd} = 0.175 \pm 0.063$.
%Notably, the \citet{Radice:2018pdn} reported a more narrow range, $(0.1, 0.2)$.
%This is a clear effect of the neutrino absorption included in our models, that elevates 
%the everal electron fraction of the \ac{DE} as it is being irradiated by neutrinos 
%during the merger.
%Notably, the $\ayd$ of our models is close to those obtained with M1

In this section we discuss the ejecta properties that are extracted at 
coordinate radius of $R=300G/c^2M_{\odot}\approxeq443\,$km from the center.
The later extraction assures that the ejecta had the longest evolution 
within the simulation domain. In addition, this allows for a consistent
comparisons with the results of \citet{Radice:2018pdn}.
We also limit the discussion to the simulations performed at a standard resolution
(ee Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:setup}). Several available simulations that 
were performed at higher resolution are used to asses the errors.
%
First, we observe that not all the simulation show the presence of the fast ejecta tail.
For instance, the fast ejecta component is absent in simulations with stiff \ac{EOS} 
and relatively high \mr{}, 
%$q=M_1/M_2\geq1$ where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the gravitational masses 
%at infinity of the primary and secondary \acp{NS} respectively.
The \ac{DE} velocity distribution from these models shows a sharp cut-off at $\leq0.5c$.
The absence of fast tail can be explained by the fact that 
at large \mr{}s the ejecta are dominated by the tidal component, whose speed 
is largely set by the \acp{NS} velocities at the last orbit and the system escape velocity.
Moreover, models with large $q$ in our set undergo prompt collapse 
with no core bounce \citep{Bernuzzi:2020txg}.


We show the mechanism that is responsible for producing most of the fast ejecta in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_v06_mech}. Specifically, we find that the 
ejection of mass with velocity $\upsilon>0.6$~c coincides coincides with core \bnc{}s, 
which was previously noted in \citet{Radice:2018pdn}.
Most of the ejecta originate at the first \bnc{} in models with moderately soft \ac{EOS} 
or large \mr{}, \eg, the equal mass BLh \ac{EOS} model. 
Similar behaviour is observed in models with higher \mr{} and softer \ac{EOS}, 
\eg, SFHo \ac{EOS} model.
However we find that additional mass ejection occurs at the second \bnc{} in models
with very soft \ac{EOS} (and small \mr{}), \eg, equal mass SLy4 \ac{EOS} model.
Notably, while the first-\bnc{} component is generally equatorial, the second-\bnc{} component 
is more polar. The possible explanation might include the increase in baryong pollytion
of the low latitude region around the \pmerg{} remnant.

%% --- Paragraph on the resolution effects and error bars 
The resolution of the simulation does not affect whether there is a fast tail 
of the \ac{DE}, but it does affect its mass, $\md(\upsilon>0.6\, c)$.
We find that the that $\md(\upsilon>0.6\, c)$ changes by a factor of a few
between SR and HR simulations.
A larger sample of simulations performed at high resolutions is required to asses this uncertainty more quantitatively.
%% --- Properties of the fast tail: ejecta mass
The mean value of the fast tail mass is
\begin{equation}
    \overline{\amd}(\upsilon>0.6\, c) = (2.36 \pm 3.89)\times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\ ,
\end{equation}
where we also report the standard deviation.


%% --- Properties of the fast tail: velocity, electron fraction
Mass-averaged properties of the fast tail,  such as velocity, electron fraction and 
angular distribution, appear robust with resolution, similarly to what is observed for 
the total dynamical ejecta (See Tab.~\ref{tab:sims}).
%% --- Table reference 
We report the properties of fast tail in Tab.~\ref{tab:sim}.
%
The mass averaged velocity, $\vd(\upsilon>0.6\,c)$, is close to $0.6c$ with 
models with softer \acp{EOS} displaying higher
The mass-averaged electron, $\yd(\upsilon>0.6\, c)$ is generally above $0.25$, 
indicating that these ejecta were shock-heated and reprocessed by neutrinos. High 
average electron fraction implies that only weak \rproc{} \nuc{} would 
occur, producing elements up to the $2$nd $r$-process peak \citep{Lippuner:2015gwa}. 
(See chapter~\ref{ch:nucleo} for the related discussion).

%% --- Total energy discussion :: Fig.1 (top)
The total kinetic energy of the fast tail, $E_{\rm k}(\upsilon > 0.6\, c)$,
is shown in top panel of the Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_v06}.
Considering the resolution dependency of the ejecta mass and, less prominently, velocity, 
we set a conservative error bar of ${\sim}1$~order of magnitude.
%
The figure shows that the $E_{\rm k}(\upsilon > 0.6\, c)$ ranges between 
${\sim}10^{46}\,$erg, and ${\geq}10^{50}\,$erg. Overall, the it does not show a 
strong dependency on the \ac{EOS}, even though models with very soft \acp{EOS} 
(like SLy4 and SFHo) tend to display larger energies. 
The dependency on the \mr{} is more noticeable, especially for the 
SLy4, SFHo and LS220 \acp{EOS}, where for the latter, the $E_{\rm k}(\upsilon > 0.6\, c)$ 
increases by ${\sim3}\,$ orders of magnitude between $q=1$ and $q=1.7$. 
Notably, for the BLh \ac{EOS} models, the $E_{\rm k}(\upsilon > 0.6\, c)$
 does not change with the \mr{}.

%% --- Angular distribution :: Fig.1 (bottom)
In the lower panel of the Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_v06} we show the \ac{RMS} 
half-opening angle of the fast ejecta around the orbital plane. 
The error of $5$~degrees is taken based on the comparison with higher resolution
simulation. The figure allows to gauge which ejecta mechanism dominates for each 
simulation, as the ejecta angular distribution depends on it.
%
For models with stiff \ac{EOS}, \eg, DD2 \ac{EOS}, where the core \bnc{} 
ejection mechanism dominate the fast ejecta tail is generally equatorial.
Meanwhile, in simulations with soft \acp{EOS} and high \mr{}s, the fast ejecta shows 
a more uniform angular distribution set by an combination of the core dynamics and 
finite temperature effects driving shocked material.

%% --- RESOLUTION DEPENDENCY 
%Comparing the total kinetic energy from simulations performed at standard and high resolutions we find that the $E_{\rm k;\, ej}$, is 
Assesing the resolution dependency of the ejecta parameters more quantitatively,
we report that for three models for which the fast ejecta 
were found in both the SR and high HR simulations, 
%% (with typical grid resolution $185$~m and $123$~m respectively) 
the $E_{\rm k \,; ej}(\upsilon_{\text{ej}} > 0.6)$ changes
by at least factor of a few. The ejecta \ac{RMS} half-opening angle about the 
orbital plane is changing by utmost ${\sim}50\%$.

%% --- KINETIC ENERGY DISTRIBUTION :: Fig.2 <---> Relevant for afterglow
% Next we consider the ejecta kinetic energy distribution, which is defined as
% $E_k(>\Gamma\beta) \propto \Gamma\beta$, 
% where $E_k = 0.5 \md (c\beta)^2$ is the kinetic energy and 
% $\beta$ is the ejecta velocity, expressed in units of $c$,
% and $\Gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.
% $E_k(>\Gamma\beta) \propto \Gamma\beta $ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_vel_hist}.
% \alp{Is this definition appropriate here? This looks like, maybe, the total kinetic energy. And why is it proportional to $\Gamma \beta$? What about:}
%
Next we consider the distribution of the cumulative kinetic energy of the ejecta. 
It is defined as the kinetic energy of the ejecta whose mass is exceeds certain velocity,
and denoted as $E_k(>\Gamma\beta)$ where following the common convention in the literature, 
we write it as a function of $\Gamma \beta$ product, with $\beta$ being the ejecta velocity 
expressed in units of $c$, and $\Gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.
%
For a subset of models the $E_k(>\Gamma\beta)$ is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_vel_hist}. 
%
The plot shows that for most models the bulk of the kinetic energy is confined to
to the low $\beta\Gamma$ matter. 
Models with soft \ac{EOS}, \eg, SLy4 \ac{EOS} and small \mr{} also show an
extended high velocity tail.
%% The fast tail of the ejecta there is clearly seen for SLy4 $q=1.00$ model. 
%% High $q$ models however, have more narrow distribution, with BLh $q=1.82$ 
The bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta_vel_hist} illustrates the 
cumulative kinetic energy distribution in terms of the $\beta \Gamma$ and angle 
from the plane of the binary for the $q=1.00$ model with BLh \ac{EOS}.
The plot shows that the distribution is not uniform with respect to the angle.
High velocity matter is more confined to the plane of the binary, however,
a large fraction of very energetic matter is channeled into polar region. 
% \alp{This final sentence is not clear to me. Maybe do you mean:
% "The distribution is not uniform with respect to the polar angle since the highly energetic components extends up to the polar region, but the highest $\Gamma\beta$ contribution is confined to an equatorial tail." or something similar?}

Notably, since the largest part (in mass) of the ejecta is equatorial it eludes the 
interaction with the \ac{GRB} collimated ejecta and expands into an unshocked \ac{ISM}.
The latter can decrease the \ac{ISM} density and delay the peak of the 
synchotron emission \citep{2020MNRAS.495.4981M}.

%% TAB WIND SUMMARY
\input{Tables/tabWind.tex}
%% --------------------------------

The interaction between the \ac{MNS} remnant and the disk produces density waves, 
that propagating outwards through the disk induce the outflow, 
the \ac{SWW} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:remdisk}).
%
The \ac{SWW} is the matter unbound according to the Bernoulli criterion 
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:method:ejecta}). Its calculation is turned on when
the \ac{DE} mass flux stops, which on average corresponds to ${\sim10}$~ms \pmerg{} 
%
First we consider two characteristic simulation that produce long- and short-lived
remnants. Both models have $q=1.00$ and their \acp{EOS} respectively, are DD2 and LS220. 
We find that if the remnant is long-lived, total \ac{SWW} mass exceeds that of the \ac{DE},
as shown also in Fig.~\ref{fig:mej:bern_short_long}.
%

\gray{
    %% From Letter
    The long lived NS remnant (DD2) develops a \ac{SWW} more massive than the dynamical ejecta,
    as shown also in Fig.~\ref{fig:ej_properties}.
    The \ac{SWW} mass is larger the longer the remnant survives and 
    the more massive the disks are. It continues as long as as the 
    remnant does not collapse and the spiral modes persist.
    Thus, binary mass asymetry can enhance the \ac{SWW}
    as we find in simulations discussed elsewhere [In Prep.].
    The inclusion of turbulent viscosity alters all the ejecta masses with an
    additional component and, for the viscosity parametrization we
    have considered, it enhances the DD2 \ac{SWW} mass by ${\sim}25$\%.
    %
    The viscosity effect is larger than resolution effects.
    Comparing data at different grid resolutions we find that the
    largest variation is in the wind mass. The relative variation
    of mass from data pairs at increasing resolutions is ${\sim}+15\%$
    (LR-SR) and ${\sim}+8\%$ (SR-HR). Hence, finite grid effects tend to
    increase mass. A similar analysis on the average electronfraction
    and velocity indicate variations below $4\%$.
    % 
    The \ac{SWW} has an angular distribution of mass similar to the
    dynamical ejecta with material mostly confined to the orbital plane,
    as shown by the histograms in Fig.~\ref{fig:ej_properties}.
    On the contrary, the velocity profiles show a drastic difference
    between the two ejecta components. While the dynamical ejecta has a
    broad velocity distribution \citep{Hotokezaka:2012ze,Bauswein:2013yna,Radice:2018pdn}, the 
    \ac{SWW} velocity is narrowly distributed around  
    $0.2$c in the case of a long-lived remnant (DD2).
    The \ac{SWW} from the short-lived
    remnant (LS220) has a broader velocity distribution extending down to
    $0.1$c.
    This is due to the spiral-wave shutting down and the disk
    transition to a more steady accretion. As a consequence, the \ac{SWW}
    ceases but ejecta continue as a slower disc wind driven
    by nuclear recombination solely.
    The electron fraction of the \ac{SWW} has a
    narrower distribution than the dynamical ejecta in both
    cases. But because disks around NS remnants are less compact, 
    colder, and optically thicker than those around black
    holes~\citep{Perego:2019adq}, the outer layers of the DD2 disk have a 
    lower $Y_e$ than the LS220 disk and so does the \ac{SWW} coming from
    those layers.
    While the \ac{SWW} is generic in its hydrodynamics origin, the
    quantification of its properties relies on the accurate microphysics and
    neutrino treatment in our simulations.
}






We report the overall properties of the \ac{SWW} for all the models with the 
long-lived \ac{MNS} remnant that were also evolved for a sufficiently long time 
in the Tab.~\ref{tab:spiralwavewind}. 
The time evolution of the total mass of the \ac{SWW} is shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig:mej:bern}.
We observe that in all simulations \acp{SWW} persists till end without saturation.
This is because the outflow is driven by the angular momentum and mass transport 
induced by the dynamical instabilities in the remnant, the $m=1,2$ modes, discussed 
above. And as the $m=1$ modes are not efficiently damped \citep{Paschalidis:2015mla,Radice:2016gym,Lehner:2016wjg,East:2016zvv},
the \ac{SWW} could theoretically continue until the system collapses to a \ac{BH} 
or reaches the equilibrium (Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_dynsmics_overview}).

The strongest \ac{SWW} is found in binaries with $q>1$, such as 
$q=1.67$ and LS220 $q=\red{1.4}$. 
With the mass-loss rate ${\sim}0.5\, \Msun/{\text{s}}$, these models can eject 
${\sim}0.02\,\Msun$ within ${\sim}50$~ms of \pmerg{} evolution.
We find that as the \ac{EOS} becomes softer, lower \mr{} is needed to achieve high 
mass flux. For instance, the \ac{SWW} mass flux for BLh* $q=1.66$ is achieved by the 
model LS220* with $q=1.22$. 
A possible explanation for this is that the models with softer \ac{EOS} have stronger 
$m=1$ modes in the remnant (see Sec.~\ref{sec:bns_sims:remdisk}).
When \ac{MNS} remnant collapses to a \ac{BH} and the mechanism that injects angular 
momentum into the disk shuts down, the \ac{SWW} mass flux subsides. 
Thus, the total ejected mass via \ac{SWW} is directly related  o the lifetime of the 
\ac{MNS} remnant, an addition to the binary parameters, \ac{EOS} and \mr{}.

The \ac{SWW} mass flux depends on the disk configuration, as more extended disks 
have outer layers that are less gravitationally bound. In turn, the disk 
configuration is dependent on the thermal effects. Higher temperature leads to 
stronger thermal pressure that increases the disk size. 
However, the dependency of the \ac{SWW} mass flux on the stiffness of the \ac{EOS} 
appears to be stronger, as the stiffer \ac{EOS} leads to a more massive disk 
(Sec.~\ref{sec:overview}). More simulations with longer postmerger evolution are needed 
to make a quantitative assessment. 
Overall the \swind{} from the long-lived remnant has a mass flux $\geq 0.4\, \Msun/{\text{s}}$.

We find that the properties of the \ac{SWW} depend only weakly on the binary parameters,
\mr{} and \ac{EOS}. The mass-histograms of the wind angular distribution, velocity and 
electron fraction are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta:bern:hist}. 
The angular distribution of the \ac{SWW} is similar to that of the \ac{DE}. The ejecta 
has a broad distribution around the binary plane.
The \ac{SWW} has a high average electron fraction, with the overall 
broad distribution of $0.1\lesssim \ayw\lesssim0.4$ that peaks at ${\sim}0.35$.
The low electron fraction material originates primarily at early times, when the 
material did not have enough time to be processed by neutrinos and before the 
outflow reaches quasi-steady state.
The \ac{SWW} average velocity is higher for stiffer \ac{EOS}, with the peak 
of the distribution laying between ${\sim}0.1\,$c and ${\sim}0.2\,$c.
However, more simulations of the \ac{MNS} remnants long-term evolution are 
required to confirm and quantitatively investigate this trend.
However, if it is indeed a generic feature, then it might imply 
an \ac{EOS} dependent distinct feature in the electromagnetic counterpart. 
In particular, the observation of a fast blue kN given by the \swind{}
should be associated to a stiff \ac{EOS}.

%% It is however expected, that as the system becomes more stationary and larger part 
%% of the disk accrets on the \ac{MNS} the outflow should subside.

    %
    \label{fig:slice:heating_hu}
\end{figure*}

In this section we investigate in detail the 
high electron fraction, polar component of the \acp{SWW}.
We propose that this outflow is mostly driven by the neutrino 
reabsorption, rather than by the dynamical mechanism responsible for the bulk of the 
\ac{SWW}.

The presence of the baryonic winds developing on the timescale of $\mathcal{O}(10)$~ms
and driven by the neutrino absorption above the remnant, where the neutrino flux is strong 
was reported before \citep[\eg][]{Perego:2014fma}. 

In this section we focus of the feducial model BLh $q=1.00$ (SR). 

In the left column of plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:slice:heating_hu} we compare 
the the Bernoulli parameter, 
$-hu_t$ (see Sec.\ref{sec:method:Bernoulli}), and the fluid electron 
fraction. 

In the right column of plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:slice:heating_hu} we compare 
the the Bernoulli parameter with the heating energy rate due to electron anti-neutrino absorption 
$Q_{\text{abs};\:\bar{\nu}_e}$ (see Sec.~\ref{method:M0:eq_for_Q}) divided by with 
$D=W\rho\sqrt{\gamma}$ (fluid's conserved rest-mass density)
We observe that the electron fraction in the polar region with angle 
from binary plane $\theta>60^{\circ}$ reaches $Y_e\sim0.35$ due to the absorption of 
electron-type neutrinos.
The strongest neutrino heating occurs in the vicinity of the remnant at densities 
$\rho\sim10^{11}$~\gcm, that roughly correspond to the region where neutrinos decouple,
the so-called neutrinosphere \citep{Endrizzi:2019trv}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:slice:heating_hu} we compare the Bernoulli parameter, 
$-hu_t$ (see Sec.\ref{sec:method:Bernoulli}), that is always plotted 
on the right half of a panel, with the electron fraction (left 
column of plots and heating energy rate due to electron anti-neutrino absorption 
$Q_{\text{abs};\:\bar{\nu}_e}$ divided by with $D=W\rho\sqrt{\gamma}$ 
(fluid's conserved rest-mass density).
The observed correlation between the $E_\nu/D$ \red{???} and $-h u_t$ further suggests, 
that the outflow around the polar axis is driven by the neutrino absorption. 
Additionally, we found that if the neutrino absorption is not included into the 
simulation, \eg, using leakage only, the \nwind{} is absent. 
%% --- 
The collimated polar outflow can be further boosted and stabilized by the presence of the 
strong magnetic fields \citep{Bucciantini:2011kx,Ciolfi:2020hgg,Mosta:2020hlh}.
%% ---
Notably, there is not clear distinction between the \nwind{} and \ac{SWW}, especially 
at the intermediate latitudes ($\theta \sim 45^{\circ}$), where both mechanisms types of 
ejecta are present, and both, neutrino absorption and dyanmical effects driving the \ac{SWW} 
are contributing. 
%% --- 
In order to compute the mass flux of the \nwind{} an additional criterion is required. 
We consider two physically motivated criteria, the geometrical, flaggin the part of the \ac{SWW} 
and \nwind{} if it is polar, \ie, $\theta>60^{\circ}$, and the composition criterion, $Y_e > 0.35$.
%% --- 
We find that the \nwind{} is not a steady state outflow, contrary to the bulk of the \ac{SWW}.
After the initial strong rise, the mass flux rapidly decays in time, and for most models stops 
by the end of the simulations. This behaviour is independent of the criterion we use. 
We attribute it to the rise of the baryon loading above the remnant as the material gets lifted 
by thermal pressure from the disk.
The total mass of the \nwind{} is ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-4}M_{\odot}$. Its properties resemble those 
reported in e.g. \citet{Dessart:2008zd,Perego:2014fma,Fujibayashi:2020dvr}
Notably, in some of the works, the \nwind{} was found to require longer timescales to develop, 
achieving the quasi-steady state. 
This can be attributed to the strict criteria to isolate the \nwind{} and by the absence of the 
\ac{SWW} in other works. 
Additionally, our simulations might not be sufficiently long to achieve the donditions 
sufficient for the development of the quasi-steady state \nwind{}.
%% Additionally, as our models are at most $\sim100$~ms long, the conditions required for the steady 
%% state \nwind{} might not been achieved.

%% === FROM DYNAMICAL EJECTA SECTION of MAIN PAPER
Here we discuss the application of our results to \GW{}.


\subsection{Dynamical Ejecta}


%% ---
First, we asses the ejecta parameters that our fitting models, 
obtained in section \ref{sec:ejecta_disk_statisitcs} would provide for the \GW{}.
%% --- 
Considering the $90\%$ credible intervals estimated for $q$ and $\tilde{\Lambda}$ 
from LIGO-Virgo GW analysis
\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa,Abbott:2018wiz,De:2018uhw,Abbott:2018exr},
i.e.~$\tilde{\Lambda}=300_{-190}^{+500}$ and $q\in[1., 1.37]$. 
and using the errorbars formulas developed in \cite{Radice:2018pdn}, we find that
$\amd \in [0.72, 7.52] \times 10^{-3}\: M_{\odot}$
and
$\avd \in [0.16, 0.39]$c 
and 
$\ayd \in [0.11, 0.23]$.
Notably, these values do not agree with those inferred for \AT{} by the spherical, 
two-component kilonova models \citep{Villar:2017wcc}.
Analysis of a compiled set of kilonova fitting models provides a broad range of ejecta 
parameters \citep{Siegel:2019mlp}:
$M_{\text{ej}}^{\text{red}}\in(4, 6)\times10^{-2}M_{\odot}$ and
$\upsilon_{\text{ej}}^{\text{red}}\in(0.07, 0.14)$ for the red component, while
$M_{\text{ej}}^{\text{blue}}\in[1, 2]\times10^{-2}M_{\odot}$ and 
$\upsilon_{\text{ej}}^{\text{blue}}\in[0.2, 0.3]$ for the blue component.
%% ---
With respect to our results for \ac{DE}, however, 
none of the kilonova components can be well explained.
%% ---
In Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta:dyn:ds_sww} we show the ejecta properties from
all our models (diamonds) and the parameters inferred from the
observations as red and blue boxes. 
%% --- 
With respect to the red component, we observe that \ac{DE} from our models 
have too high average velocities and not nearly enough mass.
This result suggests that an additional, low $Y_e$ ejecta component is required
in order to explain the \AT{} red component 
\citep{Perego:2017wtu,Kawaguchi:2018ptg,Nedora:2019jhl}.
%% --- 
A more thorough analysis of the \AT{} with better ejecta models and advanced
radiation transport kilonova simulations are not part of the present work 
and will be addressed in the future.


\subsection{Spiral-wave wind}


The \ac{SWW} could be a significant contributor to the \AT{}, assuming the remnant of 
\GW{} \ac{MNS} merger survived for $\mathcal{O}(100)$~ms.
%% ---- 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta:dyn:ds_sww} we report the total
(dynamical+\swind{}) ejecta mass and mass-averaged velocity for the
simulated long-lived BNS (crosses).
%% ---
Notably, the total ejecta mass of three of our models, 
BLh $q=1.18$, BLh $q=1.42$ and  DD2 is $q=1$ are in agreemnt with the epected values 
for the blue compoent of the \AT{} 
(obtained using the two-component fit \citep{Villar:2017wcc})

\red{
    [ LETTER STUFF COULD GO HERE ]
    a multi-component fitting model that explicitly accounts
    for the \swind{} can fit the early blue
    emission from AT2017gfo \citep{Nedora:2019jhl}
}

The high electron fraction of the \ac{SWW} however would result in a lanthanides-poor
composition of the outflow. Thus, the \ac{SWW} cannot explain the observed emission 
for the high opacity, lanthanides-rich material.
%% ---
Simulations with advanced physics of a \ac{MNS} mergers on a timescales $>100$~ms are 
required to asses the contribution from other outflow mechanisms, \red{that we will discuss below} 
\citep{Lee:2009uc,Fernandez:2015use,Siegel:2017nub,Fujibayashi:2017puw,Fernandez:2018kax,Radice:2018xqa}.


\subsection{Secular Ejecta}


On the timescale of seconds, much longer than the evolution of 
presented here simulations, the nuclear recombination can unbind 
a fraction of the disk mass. 
Analytical estimates and simulations with various approximations show that up tp ${\sim}40\%$ of the disk can be ejected via viscous processes with an typical velocity ${\lesssim}0.1\,$c
\citep{Lee:2009uc,Fernandez:2015use,Wu:2016pnw,Siegel:2017nub,Fujibayashi:2017puw,Fernandez:2018kax,Radice:2018xqa,Fujibayashi:2020dvr}.

Adapting the fix fraction of the $40\%$ of the disk mass, we estimate 
that about  ${\sim}0.05\, M_{\odot}$ would be ejected in a form of 
secular winds. We include this estimate for every simulation
with the long-lived \ac{MNS} remnant in Fig.~\ref{fig:ejecta:dyn:ds_sww} (lower triangles).
The estimated mass is sufficient to explain
the red component of AT2017gfo, as inferred from the two-components kN
models of \cite{Villar:2017wcc}. 







%% ---------------------
Sources with time delay are preferred by studies of very metal poor stars that indluded the time delay for r-process elements
to diffuse through ISM, \citep{Tarumi:2021xvw}. 
A winds from proto-nuetron are also contributors to the $r$-process budget \cite{Vincenzo:2021rvw}

\red{The remnant is losing anular momentum while disk gains on shortly after merger is due to gravitational torque \cite{Shibata:2019wef}}
